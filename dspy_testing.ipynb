His surname is sometimes spelt as Gregorie, the original Scottish spelling. He inherited Kinnairdy Castle in 1664. Three of his twenty-nine children became mathematics professors. He is credited with inventing a military cannon that Isaac Newton described as \"being destructive to the human species\". Copies and details of the model no longer exist. Gregory\\'s use of a barometer to predict farming-related weather conditions led him to be accused of witchcraft by Presbyterian ministers from Aberdeen, although he was never convicted.¬ª\\n[2] ¬´David Gregory (footballer, born 1970) | Born in Polstead, Gregory began his career at Ipswich Town, making 32 appearances between 1987‚Äì1995. He made two appearances on loan at Hereford United and three appearances at Peterborough United after leaving Ipswich. He joined Colchester United in 1995 and spent seven years at Layer Road, making 226 league appearances and scoring 19 goals. Gregory helped the U\\'s to their first league promotion for 22 years in 1998 when he stepped up to put Colchester ahead from the spot in the Third Division playoff final. Gregory made history along with Neil as the first pair of brothers in a play-off final in the same match. His brother Neil joined the U\\'s in 1998 and played alongside David until 2000. Gregory featured regularly in the first team until he cracked a bone in his foot playing against Port Vale in March 2002 and failed to recover fitness by the summer break. He again teamed up with his brother Neil at Canvey Island in July 2002.¬ª\\n[3] ¬´David Gregory (footballer, born 1951) | David Harry Gregory (born 6 October 1951) is an English former footballer who played in the Football League for Blackburn Rovers, Bury, Peterborough United, Portsmouth, Stoke City and Wrexham.¬ª\\n\\n[[ ## thought_1 ## ]]\\nDavid Gregory of Kinnairdy castle was born on 20 December 1625.

      "Low memory, also known as \"lowmem,\" refers to the first 860 MB (or 896 MB on some architectures) of physical memory. This region of memory is directly addressable by the kernel and is used for kernel data structures, such as page tables, kernel stacks, and other low-level data. The kernel can directly access low memory using 32-bit pointers, which makes it more efficient for many kernel operations.\n",

      "High memory, on the other hand, refers to physical memory that is above the 860 MB (or 896 MB) threshold. This region of memory is not directly addressable by the kernel using 32-bit pointers and requires special handling to access. The kernel uses a mechanism called \"highmem\" to manage high memory, which involves temporarily mapping small chunks of high memory into the kernel's address space, allowing the kernel to access the memory indirectly.\n",

      "The distinction between high and low memory is primarily relevant on 32-bit systems, where the kernel's address space is limited to 4 GB (or 3 GB on some architectures).
