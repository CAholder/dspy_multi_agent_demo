Officials under investigation were disappeared into party compounds, hotels or other covert locations for months at a time, with no access to legal counsel or family visits. \n\nIn 2018, amid growing criticism over [widespread abuse, torture and forced confession](https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/asia/china-shuanggui-communist-party-torture/index.html), Xi scrapped the controversial practice known as \u201cshuanggui,\u201dor \u201cdouble designation\u201d \u2013a nod to the party\u2019s power to summon members for investigation at a designated time and place. \n\nBut the Chinese leader did not abolish secret detention, which had been a potent weapon in his war on corruption and dissent. Instead, it was codified by law, given a new name and placed under the purview of a powerful new state agency, the National Supervisory Commission (NSC). \n\nFounded in 2018 as part of the constitutional revision that cleared the way for Xi to rule for life, the new agency consolidated the government\u2019s anti-graft forces and merged them with the CCDI. The two agencies work hand in glove and share the same offices, same personnel and even the same website \u2013 an arrangement that expands the remit of the party\u2019s internal graft watchdog to the entire public sector. \n\nThe new liuzhi detention regime has kept many features of its predecessor, including the power to hold suspects incommunicado in custody and a lack of independent oversight. \n\nA criminal defense lawyer, who has represented Chinese officials in corruption cases, told CNN they had seen little improvement in the protection of detainees\u2019 rights under liuzhi. \n\nAd Feedback\n\nThe lawyer, who requested anonymity due to fears of retribution from the government, said many of their clients had detailed abuse, threats and forced confessions while in liuzhi custody. \n\n\u201cMost of them would succumb to the pressure and agony. Those who resisted until the end were a tiny minority,\u201d the lawyer said. \n\nLiuzhi casts a much wider dragnet than shuanggui, targeting not only party members, but anyone who exercises \u201cpublic power\u201d \u2013 from officials and civil servants to managers of public schools, hospitals, sports organizations, cultural institutions and state-owned companies. It can also detain individuals deemed to be implicated in a graft case, such as businessmen suspected of paying bribes to an official under investigation. \n\nHigh-profile liuzhi detainees include [Bao Fan](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/tech/china-bao-fan-missing-mystery-bill-hnk-intl/index.html), a billionaire investment banker, and [Li Tie](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/china/china-soccer-star-coach-li-tie-prison-sentence-intl-hnk/index.html), a former English Premier League soccer star and coach of China\u2019s national men\u2019s team. (Li was sentenced to 20 years in prison for corruption this month.) At least 127 senior executives of publicly listed firms \u2013 many of them private businesses \u2013 have been taken into liuzhi custody, with three quarters of detentions taking place in the past two years alone, according to company announcements. \n\nthe expanded jurisdiction fills longstanding loopholes in the party\u2019s anti-corruption fight and enables graft busters to go after everyday abuse of power endemic in the country\u2019s behemoth public sector, from [bribes and kickbacks in hospitals](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/24/china/china-healthcare-corruption-crackdown-intl-hnk/index.html#:~:text=China's%20health%20care%20system%20has,distributed%20at%20in%2Dhouse%20pharmacies.) to misappropriation of school funds. \n\nCritics say it is another example of the party\u2019s ever-tightening grip over the state and all aspects of society under Xi, China\u2019s most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades. \n\nAd Feedback\n\nThe liuzhi detention center in Xianyang, Shaanxi province, where Chen Jianjun was held for six months, was built in 2018.\n\nGoogle Earth/CNN\n\nIn Golog prefecture, Qinghai province, the liuzhi detention center was built between 2019 and 2021 next to a county prison.\n\nMaxar Technologies/CNN\n\nBayannur, Inner Mongolia built its liuzhi detention center with a helipad in 2018 on the site of a special education school on the far outskirts of the city.

Built between 2020 and 2022, it costs 638 million yuan ($ 87 million) and features two detention buildings, two office buildings, and two buildings for \u201cmajor cases.\u201d\n\nMaxar Technologies/CNN\n\nThe liuzhi detention center in Xianyang, Shaanxi province, where Chen Jianjun was held for six months, was built in 2018.\n\nGoogle Earth/CNN\n\nIn Golog prefecture, Qinghai province, the liuzhi detention center was built between 2019 and 2021 next to a county prison.\n\nMaxar Technologies/CNN\n\nBayannur, Inner Mongolia built its liuzhi detention center with a helipad in 2018 on the site of a special education school on the far outskirts of the city.

More detention centers have been built, and more funds have been allocated, in provinces and regions with a higher percentage of ethnic minorities. \n\nShizuishan, a city in the northwestern region of Ningxia \u2013 the official heartland of the Hui Muslim minority \u2013 was approved to build a 77,000 square feet liuzhi site with a budget of 20 million yuan ($2.8 million) in 2018, according to a . \n\nThe document provides a rare glimpse into what the interior looks like. All detention cells, interrogation rooms, and the infirmary must have fully padded walls, cabinets, tables, chairs and beds, with all edges rounded for safety. \n\nNo exposed electrical wiring or power sockets are allowed, and floors must be treated with anti-slip surfaces. All ceiling-mounted installations, including surveillance cameras, lights, fans and loudspeakers, must incorporate \u201canti-hanging designs.\u201d In the bathrooms, washbasins and stainless-steel toilets must be fully padded too, while showerheads and surveillance cameras must be mounted on the ceiling, according to the notice. \n\nThese maximized safety features are designed to prevent detainees from taking their own lives \u2013 an issue that had long dogged shuanggui detentions. \n\nBut Shizuishan\u2019s liuzhi center turned out to be too small for the influx of detainees. In June, the city published another notice seeking to expand the facility to address the problem of \u201cinsufficient facilities and equipment.\u201d The project includes a new building for interrogation, a new staff canteen and reconfiguration of existing buildings to create more detention cells. \n\nThe party never published official figures on shuanggui detention, and the numbers on liuzhi are nearly as elusive. In 2023, the only year national data was available, were detained by the NSC and its local branches across the country _._\n\nProvincial data, although patchy, has pointed to a sharp increase in the number of detentions. In the northern region of Inner Mongolia, 17 times more people were placed under liuzhi custody in 2018 than those subject to shuanggui in 2017, according to . \n\nAuthorities appear to have laid down standard construction rules for liuzhi centers \u2013 including a national plan for building these facilities between 2023 and 2027 \u2013 which were cited repeatedly in government documents and tender notices viewed by CNN. \n\nDingxi, one of the poorest cities in the northwestern province of Gansu, said its 305-million-yuan ($42 million) detention center would be built following requirements specified by the CCDI and NSC to achieve the \u201cstandardized, law-based, and professional operations\u201d of the liuzhi facility. \n\nThe massive complex, featuring 542 rooms, will include 32 detention cells, accommodation for investigators and guards to live on site, as well as other facilities to meet their daily needs, according to a 2024 budget document of the city\u2019s anti-graft agency. \n\n##  Life under liuzhi \n\nChinese officials and state media have hailed the transition from shuanggui to liuzhi as a crucial step toward what they describe as \u201cthe rule of law in anti-corruption work.\u201d \n\nThe shuanggui system had long been criticized for using threats, intense pressure or to secure confessions. A 2016 by Human Rights Watch documented 11 deaths in shuanggui custody from 2010 to 2015, and numerous instances of abuse and torture. \n\nUnlike shuanggui, which had no legal basis, liuzhi is inscribed in the national supervision law \u2013 introduced in 2018 to regulate the NSC. \n\nThe law bans investigators from collecting evidence through illegal means such as threats and deception; it prohibits insulting, scolding, beating, abusing and any form of corporal punishment of those under investigation. The law also requires interrogations to be recorded on video. \n\nSketches drawn by Chen Jianjun describing his experience in Xianyang Supervisory Commission detention center for six months in 2022.\n\nObtained by CNN\n\nBut legal experts say the legislation only wraps around a detention regime that operates outside the judicial system, lacks external oversight and remains inherently prone to abuse. \n\n\u201cIn the past, it was extra-legal. Now, some critics call it \u2018legally illegal,\u2019\u201d said a Chinese legal scholar who has studied the NSC. They spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fears of government retribution. \n\nChina\u2019s opaque court system, which answers to the Communist Party, already boasts a conviction rate above 99%. \n\nBut unlike criminal arrests, liuzhi takes place outsidethe judicial process and does not allow access to legal representation, raising concerns for potential abuse of power, said a second Chinese scholar who also requested anonymity. \n\nIn September, Zhou Tianyong, a top economist and former professor at the elite Central Party School, where the Communist Party trains its senior officials, warned that local authorities had been using corruption probes to extort money from private entrepreneurs to fill their strained coffers. \n\nIn a viral that was later censored, Zhou called for an end to the practice by local anti-graft agencies of detaining businessmen on suspected or trumped-up bribery charges and forcing them to pay for their release. \u201cIf (this trend) spreads, it will undoubtedly lead to another disaster for the national economy,\u201d Zhou wrote. \n\nIn recent years, allegations of abuse and forced confessions have emerged in multiple liuzhi cases publicized online. \n\nAmong them is Chen Jianjun, an architect-turned-local official who claimed he was deceived and forced into making false confessions of bribe-taking while detained under liuzhi in 2022 in the northwestern city of Xianyang. \n\nDuring his six months of detention, the 57-year-old was watched by rotating pairs of guards around the clock and forced to sit upright for 18 hours a day without moving or speaking, with any slightest bending of his back immediately met with reprimands from the guards, according to a written account of his experience posted on social platform WeChat. \n\nTwo people familiar with the case confirmed to CNN that the account was written by Chen and published by his daughter, Chen Lu. The post also includes photos of three sketches drawn by Chen Jianjun on toilet paper, describing his life under liuzhi. \n\nChen was only allowed to sleep for less than six hours a day under bright lights that were never switched off; in bed, he must lie on his back and keep his hands above the blanket in sight of the guards, he wrote. \n\n\u201cThe prolonged torment left me physically and mentally exhausted, with blurred consciousness, a mental breakdown, chaotic thoughts and hallucinations,\u201d Chen wrote, adding that by the time he emerged from liuzhi, he had lost 15 kilograms. \n\nChen\u2019s daughter did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for interview. His lawyer declined to comment. \n\nIn 2023, Chen was sentenced to six years in prison for accepting bribes of 2.5 million yuan ($340,000). He appealed and is waiting for a ruling, , a business magazine known for its investigative reporting. \n\nCNN has reached out to the Xianyang government and the Xianyang municipal supervisory commission for comment. \n\nThe Chinese lawyer who represented officials in court after they were released from liuzhi custody said it was common for detainees to be forced to sit in one position for up to 18 hours a day. \n\n\u201cThey had to sit continuously without moving, causing severe pressure ulcers on their buttocks. Some medicine would be applied, but they were made to continue sitting, leading to further deterioration. It was extremely torturous,\u201d they said. \n\nSome clients were also given very little food until they confessed, causing malnutrition and a host of other health problems, the lawyer said. \u201cMany people eventually developed auditory hallucinations and felt like they were losing their minds,\u201d they said. \n\nAccording to the lawyer, another tactic commonly used by investigators was to detain an official and their spouse simultaneously, even if the spouse did not hold public office. \n\nIt\u2019s a two-pronged approach: investigators can try to gather clues about the official\u2019s alleged transgression from the spouse; while the spouse can be held hostage to pressure the official to confess, the lawyer explained. \n\nIn some cases, investigators had also threatened to detain officials\u2019 children for interrogation, the lawyer added. \n\nA draft amendment to the national supervision law, which is under review by China\u2019s top legislature, appears to nod to concerns of potential abuse. It added a clause that requires investigators to carry out investigations in a \u201clawful, civilized and standardized manner.\u201d \n\nBut the draft proposal has ignored calls to allow access to legal counsel during liuzhi detention. Instead, it has suggested extending the maximum detention period from six months to eight months, if the suspect is likely to be sentenced to a prison term of 10 years or longer; the entire liuzhi period can be reset and restarted if new offenses are discovered, meaning a maximum of 16 months of custody, according to the proposal. \n\nThe draft amendment has sparked heated debate and criticism from Chinese lawyers and legal scholars, who say the powers granted to investigators during liuzhi have far outweighed the protection of detainees\u2019 rights. \n\n\u201cProlonged detention and interrogation present an extreme test that surpasses the physical and mental limits of the detainee,\u201d Dacheng, a Beijing-based law firm, said in an on its social media account. \n\n\u201cUnder such extreme conditions, where both the body and the mind are pushed to their limits, it becomes increasingly difficult to tell whether the detainee is giving an \u2018honest confession\u2019 based on facts or opting for \u2018full cooperation\u2019 by compromising the truth under unbearable pressure.\u201d \n\nHow CNN reported this story:CNN obtained tender notices containing the keyword \u201cliuzhi\u201d published online between 2017 and November 30, 2024. These were manually reviewed and classified as new detention center construction projects, expansions and transformations of existing detention facilities, and other projects.CNN identified more than 200 projects involving construction or expansion of liuzhi facilities, and compiled corresponding land area, building area, budget, bidding document dates, and construction periods for each project where data was available. CNN cross-checked these projects with government procurement notices provided by ChinaFile, an online magazine published by the nonprofit Asia Society.CNN used China\u2019s 2020 census data to determine each province\u2019s total population and ethnic minority population, as well as the national data. We categorized provinces where the proportion of ethnic minority population was higher than the national average as \u201cprovinces and regions with a higher percentage of ethnic minorities.\u201d \n\nReporting: Yong Xiong and CNN staffGraphics: Soph Warnes, Lou Robinson and Rosa de AcostaIllustration and animations: Duncan Senkumba \n", "bias": 25, "sentiment": "negative", "summary_and_assessment": "This CNN investigative piece demonstrates relatively strong journalistic standards while covering China's liuzhi detention system.

Few of the Windsor clan would have anticipated the challenges they\u2019d have to face in the infancy of [King Charles III](https://www.cnn.com/2013/06/27/world/europe/prince-charles-fast-facts/index.html)\u2019s reign. \n\nIt was perhaps best summed up by his heir apparent, Prince William, who candidly categorized 2024 as \u201cbrutal\u201d and probably \u201cthe hardest year in my life.\u201d \n\nFor Russell Myers, the royal editor of Britain\u2019s The Mirror newspaper, the past 12 months have been astonishing. \u201cIt\u2019s been a simply unprecedented time for both the individuals who have had separate health ailments, but also, in a wider sense, (a) really testing time for other members of the family.\u201d \n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\u201cCertainly, for the King and Princess of Wales to be in hospital at the same time was incredibly rare, but then to be diagnosed with cancer within days of each other was simply extraordinary,\u201d he told CNN. \n\nMyers recalled the hurricane of unfounded, and at times ludicrous, [conspiracy theories that swirled ](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/22/uk/kate-hysteria-royal-newsletter-032224-intl-scli-gbr-cmd/index.html)around Catherine earlier this year. \u201cIn all my years in the job, I\u2019ve never known a period of hysteria like it and a lot of people forgot that at the center was a young mother who had undergone a serious operation and needed time to recover,\u201d he continued. \n\nThe King and his daughter-in-law\u2019s diagnoses stunned royal-watchers, but their disclosures also heralded a change in the royal modus operandi. \n\nPeople watch a broadcast in a London pub following the announcement by the Princess of Wales that she is undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer.\n\nAaron Chown/Press Association/AP\n\n\u201cWe saw a real openness with the royal family that we haven\u2019t seen quite so much of before,\u201d said Lizzie Robinson, a royal journalist for Britain\u2019s ITV News, recalling the Princess of Wales\u2019 video messages and the monarch\u2019s disclosure that he had initially gone to hospital for a corrective procedure for an enlarged prostate. \n\n\u201cHe wanted to help raise awareness and was keen to encourage other men who might be experiencing symptoms to get checked. After he made his announcement, there was a significant rise in the searches on the NHS website,\u201d Robinson added. \u201cI think that showed the royal family were maybe taking a more modern approach in the way they deal with some things.\u201d \n\nAmid the health issues, Prince William also took a step back from his royal duties to support his family, leaving the 1,000-year-old institution without three of its most senior members. \n\n\u201cCamilla really[ kept that royal show](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/18/uk/charles-kate-health-royals-newsletter-intl/index.html) on the road for quite a few months,\u201d Robinson said, before adding that she was, of course, supported by other Windsors, including Princess Anne and the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. \n\nMyers points out that Queen Camilla \u201cwouldn\u2019t have expected to be front and center of the institution at large.\u201d \n\nHe added: \u201cCamilla\u2019s transition over the last couple of decades has been extraordinary because at one point in the not too distant history she was public enemy number one.

As he picked up extra childcare duties behind the scenes while Kate continued to recuperate, he also twice stepped up to represent the King at state events in France. The pressure on the heir would have been considerable, both personally and professionally. \n\nWhen he stood[ shoulder to shoulder with heads of state](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/06/europe/prince-william-king-charles-d-day-anniversary-intl/index.html) at the D-Day commemorations in June and again at the reopening of[ Notre Dame](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/07/style/france-notre-dame-reopens-intl-cmd/index.html) cathedral in December, we got a glimpse of how the monarchy may feel when he eventually takes the crown. He would have been aware of the optics of those moments and considered how he wanted to play them. \n\nAhead of William\u2019s Notre Dame appearance, a royal source pointed to the \u201cevolution of the Prince of Wales as a global statesman\u201d in the past two years and how this was a further example of him \u201cstepping up onto the world stage to represent the United Kingdom.\u201d \n\nAny heir to a throne must always have their destiny in the back of their minds.

While they weren\u2019t official visits on behalf of the UK government, there was an air of traditional royal tour about them, complete with stately welcomes and meetings with high-profile figures. \n\nThe visits illustrated how the couple can operate outside the royal infrastructure and promote their causes and initiatives, while simultaneously demonstrating that they can still draw crowds. \n\nThe Sussexes have also continued to push forward with their business endeavors. In March, Meghan returned to Instagram after a six-year hiatus to tease a new lifestyle venture,[ \u201cAmerican Riviera Orchard.\u201d](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/american-riviera-orchard-first-product-scli-intl/index.html) She then sent out what appeared to be a sample of what was to come \u2013 jars of strawberry jam \u2013 to friends and influencers, but movement on the project at least in public has stalled in the months since. \n\nTheir latest Netflix offering, which gave viewers an inside look at the world of professional polo, received mixed reviews when it was released in December.

The beating was described in a deposition by an investigator for the New York Department of Corrections Office of Special Investigations.\n\nBrooks had been transferred to Marcy Correctional Facility on the day of the attack from nearby Mohawk Correctional Facility.\n\nHe was pronounced dead at a local hospital the following day, according to New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office is investigating the incident.\n\n\"As attorney general, you have my word that we will use every possible tool to investigate this death thoroughly and swiftly,\" James said in a press conference Friday.\n\nBody-worn camera footage from correctional officers at the Marcy Correctional Facility released by the New York Attorney General's Office\n\nNew York Attorney General's Office\n\nElizabeth Mazur, an attorney for the Brooks family, told ABC News, \"Members of the public can now view for themselves the horrific and extreme nature of the deadly attack on Robert L. Brooks. As viewers can see, Mr. Brooks was fatally, violently beaten by a group of officers whose job was to keep him safe. He deserved to live, and everyone else living in Marcy Correctional Facility deserves to know they do not have to live in fear of violence at the hands of prison staff.\"\n\nDetails of Brooks' death were outlined in the state investigator's deposition filed Tuesday by New York State Police.\n\nThe deposition was filed by Ryan Paparella, an investigator for the Department of Corrections and Community Services and was brought in to review this incident. In the deposition, Paparella , details his assessment of the body camera footage showing Brooks' attack.\n\nPaparella did not mention any apparent provocation or motive in his deposition and noted Brooks had his arms and legs restrained throughout the 15-minute assault. Paparella is a former corrections officer at the same prison where the incident took place.\n\nPaparella's deposition stated: \"The male was on the ground [outside near a fence]... I observed correction officers pick up the male off the ground who was handcuffed with his hands behind his back. The hands of the black male were extended directly above his head as his upper torso was parallel with the ground. They continued to walk the male down the sidewalk and towards an open door of the infirmary.\"\n\nBody-worn camera footage from correctional officers at the Marcy Correctional Facility released by the New York Attorney General's Office\n\nNew York Attorney General's Office\n\nPaparella reported a corrections officer delivered a \"closed fist strike to the chest\" while Brooks was handcuffed, and detailed officers pushing Brooks' body up against an interior window.\n\nPreliminary findings of Brooks' autopsy by the Onondaga County Medical Examiner's Office, \"show concern for asphyxia due to compression of the neck as the cause of death, as well as the death being due to actions of another,\" New York State Police wrote in a court filing.\n\nPaparella detailed that two sergeants and a nurse watched the attack and neglected to intervene. They are among the 14 prison staffers whom New York Gov. Kathy Hochul ordered to be terminated by the state.\n\n\"Like all New Yorkers, I was outraged and horrified after seeing footage of the senseless killing of Robert Brooks. I have been clear that it is the responsibility of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision to provide appropriate care and protection for those in its custody, and I will not tolerate anyone who violates that responsibility,\" Hochul said in a statement Friday. \"The State of New York has zero tolerance for individuals who break the law, and I am committed to holding everyone involved fully accountable.\"\n\nOne of the officers who Paparella reported participated in the incident is currently facing civil litigation for his alleged involvement in the 2020 beating of another inmate at Marcy Correctional, according to court records.\n\nThe New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association issued a statement reading, \"What we witnessed is incomprehensible to say the least and is certainly not reflective of the great work that the vast majority of our membership conducts every day... This incident has the potential to make our correctional facilities even more violent, hostile, and unpredictable than ever before.\"\n\nThe Correctional Association of New York (CANY), a state oversight group, said in a statement that terminating staff involved in the incident \"is a good start, but Governor Kathy Hochul and the legislature must go much further.\"\n\n\"They need to take bold and courageous actions to fulfill past commitments and bring about a new era of transparency and accountability in state government,\" the reads.\n\nA 2023 CANY on Marcy Correctional Facility found that four out of five prisoners reported witnessing or experiencing abuse and seven out of 10 prisoners reported racial discrimination from guards.\n\nOne person interviewed at Marcy correctional facility told CANY: \"Physical abuse is rampant; the [correction officer] told me when I got here: 'This is a hands-on facility, we're going to put hands on you if we don't like what you're doing.'\"\n\nThe New York Civil Liberties Union stated Brooks' death \"highlights a culture of violence and a lack of accountability for wrongdoing by corrections officers that puts the lives of incarcerated New Yorkers at risk.\"\n\nA 2024 review by the Department of Justice found that at least 28 incarcerated people were murdered while in custody during 2022, with 50 deaths classified as \"accidental,\" a term that is not defined in the report.\n\nJames, the attorney general, announced Friday that four involved officers did not turn their body-worn cameras on, which violates state policy, however, the cameras recorded in standby mode with no audio.\n\nDepartment of Corrections Commissioner Daniel F. Martuscello III issued a memo this month, stating corrections officers' must have their body cameras actively recording during any interaction with inmates. Martuscello wrote that employees must \"immediately report any individual who intentionally or unintentionally circumvents the [body-worn camera] policy.\"\n\n\u201cThis was a killing, and people will be held accountable,\" according to a statement issued by Martuscello following Brooks' death. \u201cNo one is above the law and everyone who works here is held to the highest ethical standards. These individuals are not representative of the culture of DOCCS nor anything that DOCCS stands for. I am committed to vigorously pursuing justice for the Brooks family and ensuring that our agency takes the necessary steps to heal the community.\u201d\n\nBrooks was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2017 for stabbing his girlfriend in Monroe County.\n\nThirteen of the staffers have been suspended without pay and one resigned the day after the incident.\n\nThe investigation is still ongoing with the New York AG's Office and the NY Dept of Corrections Office of Special Investigations.\n\n## [California man fatally shot by his parole officer, authorities say\n\n  * Dec 27, 5:54 PM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/california-man-fatally-shot-parole-officer-authorities-117158104)\n\n## ['Deeply concerned': Reagan FBI director urges caution against Trump appointees\n\n  * Dec 28, 10:30 AM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/reagan-fbi-director-urges-caution-gabbard-patel/story?id=117166000)\n\n## [Churches close their doors as fewer Americans attend\n\n  * Dec 28, 9:18 AM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/churches-fight-stay-open-attendance-dwindles/story?id=116905100)\n\n## [Woman sleeping in truck killed in explosion at Tyson Foods plant\n\n  * Dec 27, 1:13 PM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-sleeping-truck-killed-explosion-tyson-foods-plant/story?id=117153151)\n\n## [Azerbaijan Airlines crew member who survived plane crash speaks out from hospital\n\n  * Dec 28, 6:26 AM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/International/survivors-azerbaijan-airlines-plane-crash-report-hearing-bangs/story?id=117150667)\n\n### ABC News Live\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n\nBack Button\n\n### Performance Cookies\n\nFilter Icon\n\nClear\n\ncheckbox label label\n\nApply Cancel\n", "bias": 25, "sentiment": "negative", "summary_and_assessment": "This article demonstrates strong journalistic practices with minimal bias, though it naturally carries a negative sentiment due to its subject matter.

In April, he won the Masters before going on to win gold at this year\u2019s Olympic Games in Paris. In total, Scheffler won seven events on the PGA Tour in 2024, including the TOUR Championship. \n\nScheffler also won the Hero World Challenge and helped lead Team USA to its tenth straight win at the Presidents Cup. \n\nScheffler won the 2024 Masters Tournament during a roller coaster year.\n\nWarren Little/Getty Images\n\nIt was an equally memorable year off the course for the Olympic Gold medalist. Scheffler and his wife Meredith welcomed their first child on May 8 this year, just over a week before Scheffler played in the PGA Championship. \n\nIt was during that tournament that Scheffler was [arrested](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/17/sport/scottie-scheffler-detained/index.html), charged with felony assault and released from jail before shooting a stellar 5-under par on day two of the event. All charges against the golfer were [later dismissed](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/29/us/scottie-scheffler-court-hearing/index.html). \n\nScheffler will be hard-pressed to ever have a more eventful year than he had in 2024, and his 2025 season will now be getting off to a much quieter start after his injury. \n\nScheffler expects to return to competition in mid-January at The American Express tournament at La Quinta, California, according to Smith. \n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n", "bias": 15, "sentiment": "neutral", "summary_and_assessment": "The article maintains a highly objective stance in reporting Scheffler's injury and its impact on his tournament schedule.

The bill gives wide latitude to the president to delay its enforcement if there\u2019s progress being made towards a deal that ensures TikTok isn\u2019t fully controlled by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. \n\nBut the deadline for that determination is January 19th, which is one day before Trump is set to be sworn in.\n\nIn his Supreme Court filing, Trump asks for the bill\u2019s January 19th deadline to be stayed, arguing that the deal he\u2019d negotiate \u201cwould obviate the need for this Court to decide the historically challenging First Amendment question presented here on the current, highly expedited basis.\u201d \n\nHe offers no details on what said deal would look like, though it would likely have to involve ByteDance selling a signification portion of its ownership in TikTok to an American company.\n\n### Related\n\n  * [The long-shot plan to save TikTok from a US ban](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320722/frank-mccourt-project-liberty-tiktok-us-ban-bytedance)\n  * [TikTok failed to save itself with the First Amendment](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316941/tiktok-divest-ban-court-ruling-breakdown-first-amendment)\n\n\n\nTrump argues that having over 14 million followers on TikTok, along with his ownership of Truth Social, gives him unique ability to \u201cevaluate TikTok\u2019s importance as a unique medium for freedom of expression, including core political speech.\u201d He also cites [Brazil\u2019s temporary ban of Elon Musk\u2019s X](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24232573/brazil-x-twitter-ban-elon-musk) as an example of \u201cthe historic dangers presented\u201d by a government banning a social media platform.\n\nWhile Trump [pushed aggressively for a TikTok ban](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445060/trump-tiktok-wechat-ban-us-apple-app-store-google-play-commerce-department) during his first term, he changed his tune after his campaign successfully used the video app during the 2024 election.

The fires caused property damage.\n\nA lawyer representing Colantonio declined to comment.\n\nWithout the quick action of first responders who arrived at the church at about 12:12 a.m. following reports of an individual trying to set fires, the damage to the house of worship would have been catastrophic, investigators said at the time.\n\nZachary Cunha, U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island, said at the time of that a search of his home turned up notebooks and writings that included phrases like \u201cburn churches down to the ground,\u201d \u201chunt them down,\u201d and \u201cgun everyone down who isn\u2019t white.\u201d\n\nThe plea agreement, which was filed in federal court last week, states that Colantonio intentionally targeted the church because of the \u201cactual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, and/or ethnicity of the congregants.\u201d\n\nMost of the Pentecostal congregation, which has been established for about 35 years, is Black and African American, according to investigators.\n\nNo injuries were reported.\n\nColantonio faces four counts: obstruction of the free exercise of religious beliefs; malicious damage by means of fire; and two counts of assault on a federal officer.\n\nIf served consecutively, Colantonio faces 56 years in prison, with a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years, a fine of $1 million and three years of supervised release.\n\nA change of plea hearing is scheduled for Jan. 7.\n\n[](https://abcnews.go.com/US/pregnant-woman-stabbed-14-times-pizza-delivery-driver/story?id=117123714?id=117123714&cid=referral_taboola_feed)[Pregnant woman stabbed 14 times by pizza delivery driver over $2 tip: Police](https://abcnews.go.com/US/pregnant-woman-stabbed-14-times-pizza-delivery-driver/story?id=117123714?id=117123714&cid=referral_taboola_feed \"Pregnant woman stabbed 14 times by pizza delivery driver over $2 tip: Police\")\n\n[](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/trailblazing-model-dayle-haddon-dies-suspected-carbon-monoxide-117167637)[Trailblazing model Dayle Haddon dies from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/trailblazing-model-dayle-haddon-dies-suspected-carbon-monoxide-117167637 \"Trailblazing model Dayle Haddon dies from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning\")\n\n[](https://abcnews.go.com/US/ceo-killing-suspect-mangione-manhattan-court-arraignment-state/story?id=117041573?id=117041573)[Luigi Mangione's attorney blasts police, mayor for using the accused CEO killer as 'political fodder'](https://abcnews.go.com/US/ceo-killing-suspect-mangione-manhattan-court-arraignment-state/story?id=117041573?id=117041573 \"Luigi Mangione's attorney blasts police, mayor for using the accused CEO killer as 'political fodder'\")\n\n## [California man fatally shot by his parole officer, authorities say\n\n  * Dec 27, 5:54 PM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/california-man-fatally-shot-parole-officer-authorities-117158104)\n\n## ['Deeply concerned': Reagan FBI director urges caution against Trump appointees\n\n  * Dec 28, 10:30 AM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/reagan-fbi-director-urges-caution-gabbard-patel/story?id=117166000)\n\n## ['Shocking scene' reported after Kilauea's latest eruption\n\n  * Dec 27, 9:55 AM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/kilauea-volcano-hawaii-safety/story?id=117140944)\n\n## [Woman sleeping in truck killed in explosion at Tyson Foods plant\n\n  * Dec 27, 1:13 PM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-sleeping-truck-killed-explosion-tyson-foods-plant/story?id=117153151)\n\n## ['Shocking' footage shows handcuffed inmate who died after prison guards beat him\n\n  * Dec 27, 4:23 PM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/shocking-footage-shows-handcuffed-inmate-died-after-prison/story?id=117150189)\n\n### ABC News Live\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n\n## Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sale/Sharing\n\nSome states provide residents (or, in some cases, their authorized agents) with the right to opt out of \u201ctargeted advertising,\u201d \u201cselling,\u201d or \u201csharing\u201d of personal information.
