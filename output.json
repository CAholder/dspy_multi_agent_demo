Not only has it struggled to cope with a safety and quality control crisis, it has lost billions of dollars following a strike by workers that paralysed production at two of its biggest factories.**\n\nEven its space programme has been in trouble. Two astronauts were left stranded on the International Space Station in June after their Boeing Starliner capsule developed a potential fault, which would have made returning to Earth in it too dangerous.\n\nOn top of all this, the company faces a crisis of confidence from within its own ranks, says Bjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical and economic analyst at industry consultants Leeham Company. \n\n\"People in Boeing don't believe in words from top management any more,\" he says.\n\nReuters\n\nBoeing factory workers protest outside a production facility in Renton, Washington\n\nSam Mohawk is a 51-year-old quality assurance investigator at Boeing's factory in Renton near Seattle, a huge plant where the [737 Max is built.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/c2g0x3qg9q1t) It is the company's best-selling aircraft, but one with a chequered safety record. \n\nEarlier this year Mr Mohawk came forward as a whistleblower, claiming that chaos on the factory floor in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic had led to thousands of faulty or \"non-conforming\" parts going missing, and potentially being fitted aboard aircraft that have since been sent to customers.\n\n\"The whole system was just in shambles,\" he says of that period. \"It [had] kind of just broken down.\"\n\nHis allegations came to light in June when they were referred to during a congressional hearing in Washington DC into safety failures at the aerospace giant.\n\nDuring the session, Boeing's top bosses were accused by Republican Senator Josh Hawley of \"strip-mining\" the company for profit and cutting corners on safety in order to boost earnings. \n\n[David Calhoun](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68157266), who was Boeing's chief executive at the time, said he \"didn't recognise\" Mr Hawley's depiction of the company. \"That is not the way we operate,\" Mr Calhoun said back then. \"I am proud of every action we have taken.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nDavid Calhoun was previously Boeing's chief executive\n\nSince then, Boeing has appointed a new chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, who has pledged to \"restore trust\" in the business, overhaul its corporate culture and prioritise the safety of passengers. The company is also in the process of implementing a comprehensive safety and quality plan, which was launched earlier in the year.\n\nBut according to Mr Mohawk, who still works at Boeing, the drive to build planes as quickly as possible in order to maximise revenues remains. The accountants, he insists, are \"100%\" running the operation.\n\n\"Nothing has changed,\" says Mr Mohawk. \"Our executives talk to the press and say, 'quality and safety is our number one priority'. But it's just the same.\"\n\nBoeing rejects Mr Mohawk's claims. It insists they have been thoroughly investigated and that none of them were found to be valid. \n\nIn a statement, it said: \"Boeing data systems do track parts, including non-conforming parts. The investigations into Mr Mohawk's claims found no evidence that defective parts were installed on Boeing planes, and none of the issues raised affected safety.\"\n\nAlamy\n\nWhistleblower Sam Mohawk says: \"Our executives talk to the press and say, 'quality and safety is our number one priority'. But it's just the same\"\n\nAnother Boeing employee called Nathan (not his real name), who works in the company's Everett factory in Washington state, where the 777 is built, [describes low staff morale and corners being cut on the production line.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce9jvj83zkvo) Employees \"don't always follow the rules because they feel the pressure from their manager, and so they are not taking steps to ensure their own safety\", he claims.\n\nBut Mike Dunlop, an aerospace industry veteran and author of a book about turning around failing businesses, argues that Boeing has in fact already begun the process of transforming itself by going back to basics.\n\nHe believes many of Boeing's problems result from the arrogance of the company's management in the past, as it sought to cut costs in an effort to make more money. Recently, he says, there have been some improvements. \n\n\"I've seen the biggest changes in the company since the 1960s. What Kelly Ortberg is doing is focusing back on their core principles, which is to build airplanes as effectively and safely as possible, and be a reliable supplier to the airlines.\"\n\nArguably, the market needs Boeing to be healthy. It remains a huge company, employing more than 150,000 people directly, and countless more in supply chains around the world. It is a significant contributor to the US economy.\n\nBut some insiders argue that it now has a credibility problem and needs to restore confidence.\n\n## Crashes and the 737 Max\n\nBoeing's challenging year began on 5 January with a routine evening flight from Portland International Airport in Oregon to Ontario, California. The plane, a brand-new Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines, had taken off minutes earlier and was climbing when something went badly wrong.\n\n\"Er, yeah, we'd like to go down,\" a female voice said over the radio as the crisis erupted at 16,000ft. \"Alaska 1282 declaring an emergency\u2026 we're descending to 10,000\u2026 we're depressurised.\"\n\nReuters\n\nThe Boeing 737 Max was forced to make an emergency landing\n\nMoments earlier on the flight deck, First Officer Emily Wiprud had been exchanging routine messages with air traffic control, then there was a loud bang, a sudden rush of wind and her radio headset was torn off. Air pressure in the aircraft plummeted, as did the temperature.\n\nMs Wiprud and the captain hurriedly put on oxygen masks, then worked together with calm urgency to bring the damaged aircraft to the ground.\n\nWhat had happened was deeply disturbing. A panel fitted over an unused emergency exit had not been bolted into place properly and had come away as the plane was climbing, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigated the incident. \n\nThe passengers were still strapped in and no one was seriously hurt. But as investigators pointed out, it could have been much worse.\n\nWhat made the incident stand out was the fact that the 737 Max was Boeing's newest aircraft and its bestselling model in history.\n\nSince its entry into service, more than 1,600 have been sent to airlines and a further 4,800 are on order. But even before this, its safety record was tarnished.\n\nEuropean Pressphoto Agency\n\nWreckage from the Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash en route to Nairobi, Kenya\n\nIn late 2018, an aircraft went down in the sea off the coast of Indonesia. Four months later another plane crashed minutes after [take-off from Ad](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-47553174)[d](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-47553174)[is Ababa in Ethiopia.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-47553174) A total of 346 people were killed.\n\nBoth accidents were ultimately blamed on a poorly designed piece of flight control software. This had been fitted to address handling quirks on the new plane, and prevent pilots, who were used to earlier versions of the 737, from needing expensive retraining.\n\nIn practice, it became active at the wrong time, and forced both aircraft into catastrophic dives, according to investigators.\n\n## Did cost cutting 'jeopardise safety'?\n\nSome critics blame these accidents on a focus on the bottom line at the expense of safety. In a statement, The Foundation for Aviation Safety, which is chaired by ex-Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson, said: \"Attention to share price and profit margins alone has proven to be a flawed strategy.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of those crashes, the 737 Max was grounded[ for 20 months](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47536502) as regulators examined every aspect of its design.\n\nThe company faced criticism over its corporate culture. A congressional report released in September 2020 found that Boeing's rush to build new aircraft as quickly as possible while cutting costs had \"jeopardised the safety of the flying public\" \u2013 although its findings were described as \"partisan\" by one leading Republican.\n\nEPA\n\nThe 737 Max aircraft was grounded for 20 months \n\nThe incident in Portland, however, was the result of the failure by Boeing engineers to bolt the door panel back on properly, after it had been removed to repair manufacturing flaws. Yet it placed the company in the spotlight again.\n\nIn particular, it drew attention to a series of continuing quality problems that had been occurring behind the scenes at the aircraft-maker and at its main supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which makes a number of large aircraft components including the main body. \n\nThese included manufacturing defects affecting parts of fuselages, tail and rudder assemblies, as well as sealants applied as protection against the effect of lightning strikes in central fuel tanks.\n\nBut the incident also placed a renewed focus on claims made by whistleblowers from within both companies, who had suggested that the pressure from Boeing to produce aircraft quickly, and ramp up production, had compromised safety on both the 737 and 787 programmes.\n\nEPA\n\nDavid Calhoun (centre) testifies amid a safety probe into Boeing's practices\n\nThe sudden deaths of two other whistleblowers \u2013 John Barnett, who had worked in Boeing's 787 factory in South Carolina, and Josh Dean, who had been employed by Spirit \u2013 generated further headlines in 2024. It resulted in pushing the wider story about Boeing once again into the news. \n\nUS politicians made their feelings clear. Richard Blumenthal, head of the Senate subcommittee on investigations said: \"Boeing has put profits and speed of production ahead of quality and safety, and ultimately, that failing is at the core of its current difficulties.\"\n\n## The strike that 'cost Boeing $5.5 billion'\n\nAfter the Portland incident, Boeing was ordered by the US Department of Transportation to produce a comprehensive action plan \"to address its systemic quality control and production issues\".\n\nThe aerospace giant responded by publishing a detailed strategy aimed at improving its production systems, gaining more control over its supply chain, and encouraging employees to speak up on safety and quality control issues. \n\nIt also promised to strengthen its training programmes and overhaul critical processes on the production line.\n\nReuters\n\nSome experts argue Boeing's problems stem from decades of mismanagement\n\nOn 1 July, Boeing reached an agreement to take control of Spirit as part of its efforts to resolve quality problems.\n\nThere were also changes at the top of the company when Mr Calhoun, who had become chief executive a year after the incidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia, stepped down and was replaced in August by Mr Ortberg, a veteran engineer who had spent decades in the industry.\n\nBut weeks after his appointment, Boeing faced further crisis when more than 30,000 unionised workers - most of them in the company's Washington State heartlands - [went on strike](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cevypzd9gklo) over a new four-year contract, and how much Boeing would increase pay and other benefits for its workers.\n\nThe walkout, which began in September and lasted for seven weeks, held up production of the 737 Max, the 777 and the 767 freighter.\n\nGetty Images\n\n'On strike against Boeing' \n\nIn the past, the company had become accustomed to negotiating from a position of strength, only this time it was in a weak position, and according to Bjorn Fehrm, employees were out for revenge.\n\n\"It was obvious to them that the old management had basically screwed them. That was the sentiment. They were absolutely disgusted with how they had been treated in the old contract,\" he explains.\n\nThe result was a bitter dispute, at a time when the company was trying to instil a new working culture, and Mr Ortberg had promised to \"reset\" relations with its employees.\n\nBoeing had to dig deep to come up with a deal that satisfied their demands, which included a 38% pay rise over four years. According to consultants Anderson Economic Group, the strike cost the company more than $5.5 billion.\n\n## Airbus versus Boeing: the fallout\n\nAll of this came at a time when the aerospace giant was already struggling financially. In the first nine months of 2024 it racked up losses of nearly $8bn (\u00a36.3bn). As a result, it set out plans to cut 17,000 jobs, or a tenth of its workforce.\n\nBoeing's problems have taken a heavy toll on its business. Where once it went toe to toe with its [European rival Airbus](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd16pv097pxo), it has now delivered fewer aircraft in each of the past five years. \n\nIn the first nine months of 2024 it distributed 291 planes to its customers, while Airbus provided 497, according to Forecast International.\n\nFor its customers, this has been frustrating. Ryanair, one of the biggest buyers of the 737 Max, has cut its growth forecasts for next year. In the US, Southwest Airlines has had to make job cuts.\n\nReuters\n\nA Boeing 737 MAX aircraft being assembled\n\nYet Airbus is not in a position to take full advantage of this. Its own order books are full to bursting, with a backlog of nearly 8,700 planes. Like its rival, it has experienced problems with suppliers, leading to delays.\n\nMeanwhile, airlines want new planes. Estimates from both Boeing and Airbus suggest more than 40,000 new aircraft will be needed over the next two decades.\n\nThe current generation of aircraft are much more efficient and cheaper to run than their predecessors. So delays in renewing their fleets will cost airlines money \u2013 potentially leading to higher ticket prices for their passengers - as well as hampering efforts to improve their environmental performance.\n\nAccording to Mr Fehrm, all this creates an opening for a third player to take a stake in the market. \"Over the next five to 10 years there will be a gap between what the market is asking for and what Airbus and Boeing can deliver by thousands of aircraft.\n\n\"So it's open for a third player. Brazilian manufacturer Embraer is a candidate. Or it's going to be a chance for Comac, the Chinese supplier, to come into different markets and say, 'Actually, we can do a decent job here.'\"\n\n## A 'borderline miraculous' revival?\n\nIn early December Mike Whitaker, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), visited the factory in Renton near Seattle that Mr Mohawk has raised concerns about. At the time, Mr Whitaker said: \"What's truly needed is a fundamental cultural shift that's oriented around safety, quality improvement and effective employee engagement and training.\n\n\"As expected, Boeing has made progress executing its comprehensive plan in these areas, and we will continue to closely monitor the results as they begin to ramp up production following the strike.\"\n\nBut for many experts, the problems at Boeing go back decades \u2013 and are unlikely to be solved overnight.\n\n\"The hardest thing to change in large companies is the mindset of people,\" says Mr Fehrm. \"It takes time, and it needs to be manifested in actions, doing things differently.\n\n\"There are changes coming, but people won't look at what the top management under Kelly Ortberg say. They will look for actions.\"\n\nReuters\n\nCEO Kelly Ortberg visits a plant in Everett, Washington\n\nSome observers believe Mr Ortberg has an opportunity now to improve the company's fortunes. Mr Dunlop thinks a change in mindset will be fundamental to Boeing's future.\n\n\"The fastest way to turn around a company is to have a complete change in attitude on how you treat your employees, how you treat your customers, and most importantly in how you treat your suppliers.\"\n\nA complete reversal of its previous approach could produce a \"borderline miraculous\" revival, he believes.\n\nBut others are less confident. Captain Dennis Tajer, the lead spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association (the pilots' union for American Airlines), believes real change at Boeing has to come, not from the boardroom, but from further down the company's ranks. \n\n\"The solution is below senior management,\" he argues.\n\n\"It's at the middle management level, where you find the gatekeepers and the people who support doing things properly, not just keeping the schedule going.\"\n\nThe stakes, he insists, could not be higher.\n\n_Top image credit: Alamy_\n\n[ _BBC InDepth_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/bbcindepth) _is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

Brazoria County is about 45 miles south of Houston. \n\n\u201cWe are still conducting secondary searches and going through and ensuring that all the residents are accounted for,\u201d Polston said. \u201cAt this point we don\u2019t expect there to be additional fatalities.\u201d \n\nThe other fatality was a high school student in Natchez, Mississippi, who died after a tree fell on a home, according to Adams County Emergency Management spokesperson Neifa Hardy. \n\n\u201cAdams County is reporting one home in Natchez that has been destroyed or collapsed, with one individual deceased and two injured,\u201d Malary White, Mississippi Emergency Management director of external affairs, told CNN. \n\nNearly 7 million Americans are currently under a tornado watch, including more than 2 million people in parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, where one such watch was upgraded to a rare \u201cparticularly dangerous situation.\u201d The watch calls for \u201cnumerous strong tornadoes\u201d until 9 p.m. CST, according to . \n\nThis is , issued only when there\u2019s unusually high confidence in the potential of multiple, long-lived tornadoes of EF2-strength or stronger in the area, according to the weather service. In this case, \u201cseveral EF0-EF2 tornadoes are anticipated, and a few intense (EF3+) tornadoes are likely,\u201d said the Storm Prediction Center. \n\n\u201cAn outbreak of severe storms with tornadoes, wind damage, and large hail is expected from parts of the Southern Plains, into the Lower Mississippi Valley and central Gulf Coast states,\u201d the National Weather Service said. \u201cSeveral long track tornadoes are expected.\u201d \n\nThe weather service on Saturday evening issued an additional impacting 3.5 million people for parts of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi through 2 a.m. CST. \n\nAt 12:23 p.m. CST, the weather service confirmed a tornado was reported on the ground near Cleveland, about 45 miles northeast of Houston. The tornado, which was witnessed on the ground before it lifted back up, was moving northeast at 35 mph, NWS said. \n\nAnother reported tornado was spotted in Katy, Texas, about 30 miles west of Houston, as seen in footage posted on . \n\nThe strongest tornadoes could bring \u201cwidespread damaging winds\u201d into Saturday evening, the weather service . The Storm Prediction Center has increased the tornado risk to a level 4 of 5 moderate risk of severe weather across parts of central Louisiana, Mississippi, and western Alabama. \n\nSupercell storms continue to be capable of producing intense tornadoes, widespread damaging winds of up to 80 mph and golf ball-size hail. \n\n\u201cNumerous severe/supercell thunderstorms are expected to intensify through the afternoon over east Texas and western Louisiana, spreading rapidly northeastward across the watch through early evening. Parameters are becoming increasingly favorable for tornadoes, including strong tornadoes, and widespread damaging winds through the watch period,\u201d said the Storm Prediction Center. \n\nTornadoes are much less common in the US during December, averaging only around 40 \u2013 compared to the nearly 270 seen on average in May. This year, however, there have been 1,783 tornado reports as of December 27 \u2013 well above the average of 1,347 reports. \n\nThe threat shifts Sunday to the Southeast and the East Coast \u2013 where tornado-spawning storms are possible in Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia. Rain from this storm could lead to some minor travel delays in the East Coast. \n\nMeanwhile in the West, a continued series of atmospheric river-fueled storms is delivering more rounds of dangerous waves, powerful winds, heavy rainfall and thick mountain snowfall across the Pacific Northwest and Rockies this weekend. An additional 4 to 6 inches or more rain and 1 to 2 feet of mountain snow is likely. \n\nThe East Montgomery County Fire Department said that Station 154 in New Caney, Texas, \"sustained extensive damage\" after a storm swept through the area.\n\nMontgomery County Judge Mark Keough\n\n##  Tornadoes tear through homes \n\nOmar Godoy, who lives in Katy where a confirmed tornado was spotted, was watching the tornado thriller film \u201cTwister\u201d with his nephew when they received an alert, CNN affiliate KHOU reported. \n\nWhen he stepped outside to check, he saw a tornado heading toward him. \n\n\u201cYou see debris going in circles and the funnel coming down,\u201d Godoy told KHOU. \u201cIt\u2019s scary, but it\u2019s nature.\u201d \n\nGodoy and his nephew hid in the closet for three minutes as they felt the house shake. When they emerged, they noticed the tornado had damaged the fence and roof, and other homes in their neighborhood. \n\n\u201cIt was three minutes, but it was a scary three minutes,\u201d Godoy said, adding this is the third tornado to impact their neighborhood this year. \n\nStorm damage in Porter, Texas.\n\nKatt Lomison\n\nKatt Lomison said she feels blessed to be alive after her subdivision in Porter, Texas, suffered severe storm damage on Saturday. She was in her backyard when she saw on the news there was a potential tornado in her area. \n\n\u201cI got my hallway ready, and I went outside, and then I just felt the wind come down and go in a circle with the rain, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh crap,\u2019\u201d Lomison said. \n\nAfter the storm passed, Lomison discovered her shed was flattened and trees were down throughout the neighborhood. \n\nOne house at the end of her street \u201cis like gone,\u201d she said. \u201cThe next one, the roof is completely off. Electrical poles are down on Porter Lane,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt just kept going, causing so much destruction.\u201d \n\nDrone video captured storm damage in Porter and showed multiple houses and buildings with severe roof and structural damage. \n\nDaniel Davis, the mayor of Manvel in Brazoria County \u2013 where the one person was confirmed dead \u2013 told CNN a tornado touched down east of Manvel near Liverpool, destroying multiple homes, schools and businesses. \n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people without power, and especially over in that area and the county, while people are on wells and septic,\u201d Davis said. \u201cSo when they\u2019re without power, they\u2019re also without water.\u201d \n\nA tornado in Brazoria County had a \u201cquick and devastating impact,\u201d Sheriff Bo Stallman told CNN, touching down in four different locations. \n\nThe tornado stayed \u201cwithin a small square mile vicinity,\u201d but its damage was \u201cextremely devastating,\u201d Stallman said. \u201cThese are just really hard to plan for because they develop so fast,\u201d he added. \n\nWhen asked whether people had enough time to take shelter before the tornado\u2019s impact, the sheriff said, \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with tornadoes is that there\u2019s not a whole lot of planning or preparation for these types of events.\u201d \n\nFrom eastern Texas to western Georgia, cities like Memphis, Nashville, Atlanta, New Orleans and Birmingham could also see an isolated chance of tornadoes as well as damaging wind gusts and large hail. \n\n\u201cThe threat area will shift eastward from parts of north and central Texas early, across east Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley today, then over the Tennessee Valley, parts of Georgia, and the central Gulf Coast tonight,\u201d says the Storm Prediction Center. \n\nAs daytime heat and humidity fuels more storms, these supercells could be capable of several tornadoes, some of which could be strong and violent. By the late evening and overnight, these storms will form into a line of severe storms capable of widespread wind damage and embedded tornadoes. \n\nA tornado tracks through McCall Creek, Mississippi, on Saturday.\n\nWxChasing\n\nVideographer Jonathan Petramala captured footage that showed a violent, long-track tornado ripping through McCall Creek in southwest central Mississippi. In the video, a woman is seen carrying her crying granddaughter. \n\nThe little girl was next door with her parents hiding in their bathroom when the tornado hit, tearing off their roof, Petramala told CNN. The footage showed dozens of uprooted trees and multiple severely damaged homes. \n\nOn Sunday, the severe storm threat weakens as it spreads to the Southeast, the East Coast and parts of the mid-Atlantic. The area includes the cities of Atlanta, Georgia, and Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina. \n\nA lower severe storm threat spreads from the Florida Panhandle to southwestern Pennsylvania.

High waves up to 15 feet could be seen as far south as the Malibu coast and across Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. \n\n\u201cDangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion can be expected. Large waves can sweep across the beach without warning, pulling people into the sea from rocks, jetties and beaches. Sudden immersion in cold water can result in cold water shock even for the most experienced swimmers,\u201d the weather service warns. \n\nHigh winds are expected to continue to blow across parts of the Pacific Northwest and the Rockies, where high wind alerts are in place. Winds gusting over 75 mph are possible, which could topple trees and power lines. \n\n\u201cWidespread power outages are expected,\u201d warns the weather service. \u201cTravel will be difficult, especially for high profile vehicles, including areas along Highway 395 and Highway 95 near Walker Lake.\u201d \n\nWinter weather alerts are in place across parts of the Cascades, Sierra Nevada and Rockies as rounds of moisture continue to impact the West. Snowfall of 6 to 18 inches and gusts potentially over 70 mph could reduce visibility and make travel nearly impossible. \n\nAlong with the snowfall, avalanche warnings have been issued for the mountains of northern Utah, including the Wasatch Range and Bear River Range. \u201cVery dangerous avalanche conditions are expected to develop on many slopes,\u201d warns the Utah Avalanche Center. \n\nHeavy rainfall is expected along the coastal portions of the Pacific Northwest and across the lower elevations of the Cascades. An additional 4 inches of rainfall is possible through the weekend, which could bring storm totals to nearly 10 inches. \n\nCNN\u2019s Tyler Mauldin contributed to this report. \n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n", "date": "2024-12-28T07:40:31Z", "topic": "other", "bias": 15, "sentiment": "negative", "summary_and_assessment": "This article provides comprehensive coverage of severe weather events affecting multiple regions of the United States, focusing on two main weather systems: tornadoes in the South and atmospheric river storms in the West.

Officials under investigation were disappeared into party compounds, hotels or other covert locations for months at a time, with no access to legal counsel or family visits. \n\nIn 2018, amid growing criticism over [widespread abuse, torture and forced confession](https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/asia/china-shuanggui-communist-party-torture/index.html), Xi scrapped the controversial practice known as \u201cshuanggui,\u201dor \u201cdouble designation\u201d \u2013a nod to the party\u2019s power to summon members for investigation at a designated time and place. \n\nBut the Chinese leader did not abolish secret detention, which had been a potent weapon in his war on corruption and dissent. Instead, it was codified by law, given a new name and placed under the purview of a powerful new state agency, the National Supervisory Commission (NSC). \n\nFounded in 2018 as part of the constitutional revision that cleared the way for Xi to rule for life, the new agency consolidated the government\u2019s anti-graft forces and merged them with the CCDI. The two agencies work hand in glove and share the same offices, same personnel and even the same website \u2013 an arrangement that expands the remit of the party\u2019s internal graft watchdog to the entire public sector. \n\nThe new liuzhi detention regime has kept many features of its predecessor, including the power to hold suspects incommunicado in custody and a lack of independent oversight. \n\nA criminal defense lawyer, who has represented Chinese officials in corruption cases, told CNN they had seen little improvement in the protection of detainees\u2019 rights under liuzhi. \n\nAd Feedback\n\nThe lawyer, who requested anonymity due to fears of retribution from the government, said many of their clients had detailed abuse, threats and forced confessions while in liuzhi custody. \n\n\u201cMost of them would succumb to the pressure and agony. Those who resisted until the end were a tiny minority,\u201d the lawyer said. \n\nLiuzhi casts a much wider dragnet than shuanggui, targeting not only party members, but anyone who exercises \u201cpublic power\u201d \u2013 from officials and civil servants to managers of public schools, hospitals, sports organizations, cultural institutions and state-owned companies. It can also detain individuals deemed to be implicated in a graft case, such as businessmen suspected of paying bribes to an official under investigation. \n\nHigh-profile liuzhi detainees include [Bao Fan](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/tech/china-bao-fan-missing-mystery-bill-hnk-intl/index.html), a billionaire investment banker, and [Li Tie](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/china/china-soccer-star-coach-li-tie-prison-sentence-intl-hnk/index.html), a former English Premier League soccer star and coach of China\u2019s national men\u2019s team. (Li was sentenced to 20 years in prison for corruption this month.) At least 127 senior executives of publicly listed firms \u2013 many of them private businesses \u2013 have been taken into liuzhi custody, with three quarters of detentions taking place in the past two years alone, according to company announcements. \n\nthe expanded jurisdiction fills longstanding loopholes in the party\u2019s anti-corruption fight and enables graft busters to go after everyday abuse of power endemic in the country\u2019s behemoth public sector, from [bribes and kickbacks in hospitals](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/24/china/china-healthcare-corruption-crackdown-intl-hnk/index.html#:~:text=China's%20health%20care%20system%20has,distributed%20at%20in%2Dhouse%20pharmacies.) to misappropriation of school funds. \n\nCritics say it is another example of the party\u2019s ever-tightening grip over the state and all aspects of society under Xi, China\u2019s most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades. \n\nAd Feedback\n\nThe liuzhi detention center in Xianyang, Shaanxi province, where Chen Jianjun was held for six months, was built in 2018.\n\nGoogle Earth/CNN\n\nIn Golog prefecture, Qinghai province, the liuzhi detention center was built between 2019 and 2021 next to a county prison.\n\nMaxar Technologies/CNN\n\nBayannur, Inner Mongolia built its liuzhi detention center with a helipad in 2018 on the site of a special education school on the far outskirts of the city.

More detention centers have been built, and more funds have been allocated, in provinces and regions with a higher percentage of ethnic minorities. \n\nShizuishan, a city in the northwestern region of Ningxia \u2013 the official heartland of the Hui Muslim minority \u2013 was approved to build a 77,000 square feet liuzhi site with a budget of 20 million yuan ($2.8 million) in 2018, according to a . \n\nThe document provides a rare glimpse into what the interior looks like. All detention cells, interrogation rooms, and the infirmary must have fully padded walls, cabinets, tables, chairs and beds, with all edges rounded for safety. \n\nNo exposed electrical wiring or power sockets are allowed, and floors must be treated with anti-slip surfaces. All ceiling-mounted installations, including surveillance cameras, lights, fans and loudspeakers, must incorporate \u201canti-hanging designs.\u201d In the bathrooms, washbasins and stainless-steel toilets must be fully padded too, while showerheads and surveillance cameras must be mounted on the ceiling, according to the notice. \n\nThese maximized safety features are designed to prevent detainees from taking their own lives \u2013 an issue that had long dogged shuanggui detentions. \n\nBut Shizuishan\u2019s liuzhi center turned out to be too small for the influx of detainees. In June, the city published another notice seeking to expand the facility to address the problem of \u201cinsufficient facilities and equipment.\u201d The project includes a new building for interrogation, a new staff canteen and reconfiguration of existing buildings to create more detention cells. \n\nThe party never published official figures on shuanggui detention, and the numbers on liuzhi are nearly as elusive. In 2023, the only year national data was available, were detained by the NSC and its local branches across the country _._\n\nProvincial data, although patchy, has pointed to a sharp increase in the number of detentions. In the northern region of Inner Mongolia, 17 times more people were placed under liuzhi custody in 2018 than those subject to shuanggui in 2017, according to . \n\nAuthorities appear to have laid down standard construction rules for liuzhi centers \u2013 including a national plan for building these facilities between 2023 and 2027 \u2013 which were cited repeatedly in government documents and tender notices viewed by CNN. \n\nDingxi, one of the poorest cities in the northwestern province of Gansu, said its 305-million-yuan ($42 million) detention center would be built following requirements specified by the CCDI and NSC to achieve the \u201cstandardized, law-based, and professional operations\u201d of the liuzhi facility. \n\nThe massive complex, featuring 542 rooms, will include 32 detention cells, accommodation for investigators and guards to live on site, as well as other facilities to meet their daily needs, according to a 2024 budget document of the city\u2019s anti-graft agency. \n\n##  Life under liuzhi \n\nChinese officials and state media have hailed the transition from shuanggui to liuzhi as a crucial step toward what they describe as \u201cthe rule of law in anti-corruption work.\u201d \n\nThe shuanggui system had long been criticized for using threats, intense pressure or to secure confessions. A 2016 by Human Rights Watch documented 11 deaths in shuanggui custody from 2010 to 2015, and numerous instances of abuse and torture. \n\nUnlike shuanggui, which had no legal basis, liuzhi is inscribed in the national supervision law \u2013 introduced in 2018 to regulate the NSC. \n\nThe law bans investigators from collecting evidence through illegal means such as threats and deception; it prohibits insulting, scolding, beating, abusing and any form of corporal punishment of those under investigation. The law also requires interrogations to be recorded on video. \n\nSketches drawn by Chen Jianjun describing his experience in Xianyang Supervisory Commission detention center for six months in 2022.\n\nObtained by CNN\n\nBut legal experts say the legislation only wraps around a detention regime that operates outside the judicial system, lacks external oversight and remains inherently prone to abuse. \n\n\u201cIn the past, it was extra-legal. Now, some critics call it \u2018legally illegal,\u2019\u201d said a Chinese legal scholar who has studied the NSC. They spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fears of government retribution. \n\nChina\u2019s opaque court system, which answers to the Communist Party, already boasts a conviction rate above 99%. \n\nBut unlike criminal arrests, liuzhi takes place outsidethe judicial process and does not allow access to legal representation, raising concerns for potential abuse of power, said a second Chinese scholar who also requested anonymity. \n\nIn September, Zhou Tianyong, a top economist and former professor at the elite Central Party School, where the Communist Party trains its senior officials, warned that local authorities had been using corruption probes to extort money from private entrepreneurs to fill their strained coffers. \n\nIn a viral that was later censored, Zhou called for an end to the practice by local anti-graft agencies of detaining businessmen on suspected or trumped-up bribery charges and forcing them to pay for their release. \u201cIf (this trend) spreads, it will undoubtedly lead to another disaster for the national economy,\u201d Zhou wrote. \n\nIn recent years, allegations of abuse and forced confessions have emerged in multiple liuzhi cases publicized online. \n\nAmong them is Chen Jianjun, an architect-turned-local official who claimed he was deceived and forced into making false confessions of bribe-taking while detained under liuzhi in 2022 in the northwestern city of Xianyang. \n\nDuring his six months of detention, the 57-year-old was watched by rotating pairs of guards around the clock and forced to sit upright for 18 hours a day without moving or speaking, with any slightest bending of his back immediately met with reprimands from the guards, according to a written account of his experience posted on social platform WeChat. \n\nTwo people familiar with the case confirmed to CNN that the account was written by Chen and published by his daughter, Chen Lu. The post also includes photos of three sketches drawn by Chen Jianjun on toilet paper, describing his life under liuzhi. \n\nChen was only allowed to sleep for less than six hours a day under bright lights that were never switched off; in bed, he must lie on his back and keep his hands above the blanket in sight of the guards, he wrote. \n\n\u201cThe prolonged torment left me physically and mentally exhausted, with blurred consciousness, a mental breakdown, chaotic thoughts and hallucinations,\u201d Chen wrote, adding that by the time he emerged from liuzhi, he had lost 15 kilograms. \n\nChen\u2019s daughter did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for interview. His lawyer declined to comment. \n\nIn 2023, Chen was sentenced to six years in prison for accepting bribes of 2.5 million yuan ($340,000). He appealed and is waiting for a ruling, , a business magazine known for its investigative reporting. \n\nCNN has reached out to the Xianyang government and the Xianyang municipal supervisory commission for comment. \n\nThe Chinese lawyer who represented officials in court after they were released from liuzhi custody said it was common for detainees to be forced to sit in one position for up to 18 hours a day. \n\n\u201cThey had to sit continuously without moving, causing severe pressure ulcers on their buttocks. Some medicine would be applied, but they were made to continue sitting, leading to further deterioration. It was extremely torturous,\u201d they said. \n\nSome clients were also given very little food until they confessed, causing malnutrition and a host of other health problems, the lawyer said. \u201cMany people eventually developed auditory hallucinations and felt like they were losing their minds,\u201d they said. \n\nAccording to the lawyer, another tactic commonly used by investigators was to detain an official and their spouse simultaneously, even if the spouse did not hold public office. \n\nIt\u2019s a two-pronged approach: investigators can try to gather clues about the official\u2019s alleged transgression from the spouse; while the spouse can be held hostage to pressure the official to confess, the lawyer explained. \n\nIn some cases, investigators had also threatened to detain officials\u2019 children for interrogation, the lawyer added. \n\nA draft amendment to the national supervision law, which is under review by China\u2019s top legislature, appears to nod to concerns of potential abuse. It added a clause that requires investigators to carry out investigations in a \u201clawful, civilized and standardized manner.\u201d \n\nBut the draft proposal has ignored calls to allow access to legal counsel during liuzhi detention. Instead, it has suggested extending the maximum detention period from six months to eight months, if the suspect is likely to be sentenced to a prison term of 10 years or longer; the entire liuzhi period can be reset and restarted if new offenses are discovered, meaning a maximum of 16 months of custody, according to the proposal. \n\nThe draft amendment has sparked heated debate and criticism from Chinese lawyers and legal scholars, who say the powers granted to investigators during liuzhi have far outweighed the protection of detainees\u2019 rights. \n\n\u201cProlonged detention and interrogation present an extreme test that surpasses the physical and mental limits of the detainee,\u201d Dacheng, a Beijing-based law firm, said in an on its social media account. \n\n\u201cUnder such extreme conditions, where both the body and the mind are pushed to their limits, it becomes increasingly difficult to tell whether the detainee is giving an \u2018honest confession\u2019 based on facts or opting for \u2018full cooperation\u2019 by compromising the truth under unbearable pressure.\u201d \n\nHow CNN reported this story:CNN obtained tender notices containing the keyword \u201cliuzhi\u201d published online between 2017 and November 30, 2024. These were manually reviewed and classified as new detention center construction projects, expansions and transformations of existing detention facilities, and other projects.CNN identified more than 200 projects involving construction or expansion of liuzhi facilities, and compiled corresponding land area, building area, budget, bidding document dates, and construction periods for each project where data was available. CNN cross-checked these projects with government procurement notices provided by ChinaFile, an online magazine published by the nonprofit Asia Society.CNN used China\u2019s 2020 census data to determine each province\u2019s total population and ethnic minority population, as well as the national data. We categorized provinces where the proportion of ethnic minority population was higher than the national average as \u201cprovinces and regions with a higher percentage of ethnic minorities.\u201d \n\nReporting: Yong Xiong and CNN staffGraphics: Soph Warnes, Lou Robinson and Rosa de AcostaIllustration and animations: Duncan Senkumba \n", "date": "2024-12-28T05:17:58Z", "topic": "politics", "bias": 25, "sentiment": "negative", "summary_and_assessment": "This CNN investigative piece demonstrates relatively strong journalistic standards while covering China's liuzhi detention system.

Not just for myself but holding everyone together. \u2026 And I am okay with anyone criticizing me. Because again, I get paid to handle that.\u201d \n\nThe Kings are currently in 12th place in the Western Conference. \n\nBrown had a 107-88 record in regular season play in two-plus years in the capital city of California. \n\nMany coaches around the league showed their support for Brown including Brooklyn Nets coach Jordi Fernandez, who coached under Brown in Sacramento the last few seasons. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very good at what he does. In my opinion, he\u2019s one of the best,\u201d Fernandez told reporters ahead of the Nets\u2019 game against the San Antonio Spurs on Friday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here without him. Obviously, to me, it\u2019s really sad news, and I don\u2019t like it. But it\u2019s part of the business.\u201d \n\nThe firing also drew the ire of Denver Nuggets head coach Mike Malone. Malone was fired by the Kings during the 2014-2015 season. \n\n\u201cl\u2019m not surprised that Mike Brown got fired, because I got fired by the same person,\u201d Malone said. \u201c\u2026 No class, no balls. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll say about that.\u201d \n\nPreviously, Brown coached the Cleveland Cavaliers twice and the Los Angeles Lakers. He has a 455-304 career record and has made the playoffs in seven of his nine seasons as a head coach. He has also won four NBA championships including three while as an assistant coach with the Golden State Warriors. \n\nThe Kings are next scheduled to play Saturday in Los Angeles against LeBron James and the Lakers. \n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n", "date": "2024-12-28T04:44:09Z", "topic": "sports", "bias": 25, "sentiment": "negative", "summary_and_assessment": "The article reports on Mike Brown's firing from the Sacramento Kings with a generally professional and factual approach, but carries an overall negative sentiment due to the team's struggles, the timing of the firing, and the critical reactions from other NBA coaches.

Prior to this they were believed to be extinct - neither species had been spotted for a century.\n\nWhen a team of conservationists found a small population surviving on the rocky cliffs of Deserta Grande island, close to Madeira, they mounted a rescue effort. \n\nThe snails were brought to zoos in the UK and France, including Chester Zoo, where a home was created for them in a converted shipping container. \n\nChester Zoo\n\nA newly hatched snail at Chester Zoo sits on a five pence coin\n\nThe tiny molluscs are native to the windswept, mountainous island of Deserta Grande, just south-east of Madeira. Habitat there has been destroyed by rats, mice and goats that were brought to the island by humans. \n\nIt was thought that all these invasive predators had eaten the tiny snails to extinction. Then a series of conservation expeditions - between 2012 and 2017 - proved otherwise. \n\nConservationists discovered just 200 surviving individuals on the island.\n\nGerardo Garcia/Chester Zoo\n\nThe snails are native to the Desertas Islands\n\nThose snails were believed to be the last of their kind, so they were collected and brought into captivity. \n\nAt Chester Zoo, the conservation science team made a new home for 60 of the precious snails. The right food, vegetation and conditions were recreated in miniature habitat tanks. \n\n1,329 snail offspring, bred at the zoo, have now been marked with identification dots - using non-toxic pens and nail varnish - and transported back to the wild for release.\n\n\"[It's a] colour code,\" said Dinarte Teixeira, a conservation biologist at Madeira's Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests. \"This will allow us to spot them and track where they disperse to, how much they grow, how many survive and how well they adapt to their new environment.\"\n\nChester Zoo\n\nThe zoo-bred snails, carefully packed into their travel containers for their journey to Bugio Island \n\nChester Zoo\n\nThe dots are visible under ultraviolet light, which will allow the conservationists to find and monitor the snails \n\nA wild refuge has been restored for the snails on Bugio, a smaller neighbouring island in the Ilhas Desertas (Desert Islands) archipelago.\n\nBugio is a nature reserve and invasive species have been eradicated there. \n\nGerardo Garcia from Chester Zoo said that the reintroduction was \"a major step in a species recovery plan\".\n\n\"If it goes as well as we hope, more snails will follow them next spring. It's a huge team effort which shows that it is possible to turn things around for highly threatened species.\"\n\nGerardo Garcia/Chester Zoo\n\nMembers of the conservation team on Bugio Island ahead of the release of the snails \n\n\"These snails are such an important part of the natural habitat [on the islands they come from],\" explained Heather Prince from Chester Zoo. As well as being food for other native species, she explained, snails break down organic matter and bring nutrients to the soil. \n\n\"They help plants grow. All of that is dependent on the little guys - the insects and the snails that so often get overlooked.\"\n\nMore on this topic\n\n## [Trouble in Arctic town as polar bears and people face warming world](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yg344zz1ro)\n\n## [Crossbows and eerie silences \u2013 following Antarctic whales for climate change clues](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj770nrx0x9o)\n\n## [X-rays reveal tiny half-billion-year-old creature](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgxqdygpn09o)\n\n[Invasive species](/news/topics/c0x61qevvrxt)\n\n[Chester Zoo](/news/topics/c1nqnqr6e1yt)\n\n[Endangered species](/news/topics/c1xp19dn8ret)\n\n[Conservation](/news/topics/c207p54mdd3t)\n\n[Science & Environment](/news/science_and_environment)\n\n[Wildlife](/news/topics/ce2gz91g2jmt)\n\n[Nature](/news/topics/ckd09zdlvk2t)\n\n[Insects](/news/topics/cnegp3zl2pyt)\n\n[Environment](/news/topics/cnx753jenyjt)\n\nRelated\n\n## ['Murder hornets' eradicated in the US, officials say18 Dec 2024](/news/articles/c77jdjm02mvo)\n\n## [Volunteers find 24 Asian hornet nests in one week28 Oct 2024Jersey](/news/articles/cq6l2llmq9do)\n\n## [Woody the dog switches detection skills to save puffins21 Oct 2024Northern Ireland](/news/articles/c4g019y97ygo)\n\nMore\n\n[1 hr agoWhat does it take to clear an Asian hornets' nest?Experts say the battle to remove the invasive species is only going to grow.1 hr agoGuernsey](/news/articles/c74x82lvgrvo)\n\n[2 hrs agoPlight of loughs and rivers dominates environment newsFrom Lough Neagh to Belfast Lough, concerns about the health of our waterways hit the headlines.2 hrs agoNorthern Ireland](/news/articles/c8ew6r5gld9o)\n\n[7 hrs agoLost city found by accident and rhino IVF breakthrough: 2024's scientific winsMoments to celebrate included a solar eclipse seen by millions and a lost city discovered by accident.7 hrs agoScience & Environment](/news/articles/cm2v1rl32j8o)\n\n[16 hrs agoInquiry over pollution incident in River WyeWelsh Water confirms a form of oil has got into the river, adding it was investigating the source.16 hrs agoHereford & Worcester](/news/articles/c4gp4yel8kko)\n\n[1 day agoThe puppies trained to save wildlife in AfricaThe team has trained and deployed 15 dogs to work in five sub-Saharan African countries.1 day agoWales](/news/videos/cgrw4yrwe0do)\n", "date": "2024-12-28T03:07:17.655871Z", "topic": "other", "bias": 10, "sentiment": "positive", "summary_and_assessment": "This article reports on a successful conservation effort where 1,329 critically endangered snails, bred in Chester Zoo, were released on Bugio Island in the Desertas Islands archipelago.

Brooks. As viewers can see, Mr. Brooks was fatally, violently beaten by a group of officers whose job was to keep him safe. He deserved to live, and everyone else living in Marcy Correctional Facility deserves to know they do not have to live in fear of violence at the hands of prison staff.\"\n\nDetails of Brooks' death were outlined in the state investigator's deposition filed Tuesday by New York State Police.\n\nThe deposition was filed by Ryan Paparella, an investigator for the Department of Corrections and Community Services and was brought in to review this incident. In the deposition, Paparella , details his assessment of the body camera footage showing Brooks' attack.\n\nPaparella did not mention any apparent provocation or motive in his deposition and noted Brooks had his arms and legs restrained throughout the 15-minute assault. Paparella is a former corrections officer at the same prison where the incident took place.\n\nPaparella's deposition stated: \"The male was on the ground [outside near a fence]... I observed correction officers pick up the male off the ground who was handcuffed with his hands behind his back. The hands of the black male were extended directly above his head as his upper torso was parallel with the ground. They continued to walk the male down the sidewalk and towards an open door of the infirmary.\"\n\nBody-worn camera footage from correctional officers at the Marcy Correctional Facility released by the New York Attorney General's Office\n\nNew York Attorney General's Office\n\nPaparella reported a corrections officer delivered a \"closed fist strike to the chest\" while Brooks was handcuffed, and detailed officers pushing Brooks' body up against an interior window.\n\nPreliminary findings of Brooks' autopsy by the Onondaga County Medical Examiner's Office, \"show concern for asphyxia due to compression of the neck as the cause of death, as well as the death being due to actions of another,\" New York State Police wrote in a court filing.\n\nPaparella detailed that two sergeants and a nurse watched the attack and neglected to intervene. They are among the 14 prison staffers whom New York Gov. Kathy Hochul ordered to be terminated by the state.\n\n\"Like all New Yorkers, I was outraged and horrified after seeing footage of the senseless killing of Robert Brooks. I have been clear that it is the responsibility of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision to provide appropriate care and protection for those in its custody, and I will not tolerate anyone who violates that responsibility,\" Hochul said in a statement Friday. \"The State of New York has zero tolerance for individuals who break the law, and I am committed to holding everyone involved fully accountable.\"\n\nOne of the officers who Paparella reported participated in the incident is currently facing civil litigation for his alleged involvement in the 2020 beating of another inmate at Marcy Correctional, according to court records.\n\nThe New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association issued a statement reading, \"What we witnessed is incomprehensible to say the least and is certainly not reflective of the great work that the vast majority of our membership conducts every day... This incident has the potential to make our correctional facilities even more violent, hostile, and unpredictable than ever before.\"\n\nThe Correctional Association of New York (CANY), a state oversight group, said in a statement that terminating staff involved in the incident \"is a good start, but Governor Kathy Hochul and the legislature must go much further.\"\n\n\"They need to take bold and courageous actions to fulfill past commitments and bring about a new era of transparency and accountability in state government,\" the reads.\n\nA 2023 CANY on Marcy Correctional Facility found that four out of five prisoners reported witnessing or experiencing abuse and seven out of 10 prisoners reported racial discrimination from guards.\n\nOne person interviewed at Marcy correctional facility told CANY: \"Physical abuse is rampant; the [correction officer] told me when I got here: 'This is a hands-on facility, we're going to put hands on you if we don't like what you're doing.'\"\n\nThe New York Civil Liberties Union stated Brooks' death \"highlights a culture of violence and a lack of accountability for wrongdoing by corrections officers that puts the lives of incarcerated New Yorkers at risk.\"\n\nA 2024 review by the Department of Justice found that at least 28 incarcerated people were murdered while in custody during 2022, with 50 deaths classified as \"accidental,\" a term that is not defined in the report.\n\nJames, the attorney general, announced Friday that four involved officers did not turn their body-worn cameras on, which violates state policy, however, the cameras recorded in standby mode with no audio.\n\nDepartment of Corrections Commissioner Daniel F. Martuscello III issued a memo this month, stating corrections officers' must have their body cameras actively recording during any interaction with inmates. Martuscello wrote that employees must \"immediately report any individual who intentionally or unintentionally circumvents the [body-worn camera] policy.\"\n\n\u201cThis was a killing, and people will be held accountable,\" according to a statement issued by Martuscello following Brooks' death. \u201cNo one is above the law and everyone who works here is held to the highest ethical standards. These individuals are not representative of the culture of DOCCS nor anything that DOCCS stands for. I am committed to vigorously pursuing justice for the Brooks family and ensuring that our agency takes the necessary steps to heal the community.\u201d\n\nBrooks was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2017 for stabbing his girlfriend in Monroe County.\n\nThirteen of the staffers have been suspended without pay and one resigned the day after the incident.\n\nThe investigation is still ongoing with the New York AG's Office and the NY Dept of Corrections Office of Special Investigations.\n\nUndo\n\nUndo\n\nUndo\n\n[](https://abcnews.go.com/US/pregnant-woman-stabbed-14-times-pizza-delivery-driver/story?id=117123714?id=117123714&cid=referral_taboola_feed)[Pregnant woman stabbed 14 times by pizza delivery driver over $2 tip: Police](https://abcnews.go.com/US/pregnant-woman-stabbed-14-times-pizza-delivery-driver/story?id=117123714?id=117123714&cid=referral_taboola_feed \"Pregnant woman stabbed 14 times by pizza delivery driver over $2 tip: Police\")\n\nUndo\n\n[](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/new-york-correctional-officers-pummeled-handcuffed-man-death-117150786)[New York correctional officers pummeled handcuffed man before death, footage shows](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/new-york-correctional-officers-pummeled-handcuffed-man-death-117150786 \"New York correctional officers pummeled handcuffed man before death, footage shows\")\n\nUndo\n\n[](https://abcnews.go.com/amp/US/wireStory/california-man-fatally-shot-parole-officer-authorities-117158104#amp_tf=From %1$s&aoh=17353974731955&referrer=https://www.google.com?amp_gsa=1&amp_js_v=a9&usqp=mq331AQIUAKwASCAAgM=)[California man fatally shot by his parole officer, authorities say](https://abcnews.go.com/amp/US/wireStory/california-man-fatally-shot-parole-officer-authorities-117158104#amp_tf=From %1$s&aoh=17353974731955&referrer=https://www.google.com?amp_gsa=1&amp_js_v=a9&usqp=mq331AQIUAKwASCAAgM= \"California man fatally shot by his parole officer, authorities say\")\n\nUndo\n\nUndo\n\nUndo\n\nUndo\n\n## [California man fatally shot by his parole officer, authorities say\n\n  * Dec 27, 5:54 PM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/california-man-fatally-shot-parole-officer-authorities-117158104)\n\n## ['Deeply concerned': Reagan FBI director urges caution against Trump appointees\n\n  * Dec 28, 10:30 AM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/reagan-fbi-director-urges-caution-gabbard-patel/story?id=117166000)\n\n## [Churches close their doors as fewer Americans attend\n\n  * Dec 28, 9:18 AM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/churches-fight-stay-open-attendance-dwindles/story?id=116905100)\n\n## [Woman sleeping in truck killed in explosion at Tyson Foods plant\n\n  * Dec 27, 1:13 PM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-sleeping-truck-killed-explosion-tyson-foods-plant/story?id=117153151)\n\n## [Azerbaijan Airlines crew member who survived plane crash speaks out from hospital\n\n  * Dec 28, 6:26 AM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/International/survivors-azerbaijan-airlines-plane-crash-report-hearing-bangs/story?id=117150667)\n\n### ABC News Live\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n\nBack Button\n\n### Performance Cookies\n\nFilter Icon\n\nClear\n\ncheckbox label label\n\nApply Cancel\n", "date": "2024-12-28T00:23:19Z", "topic": "politics", "bias": 15, "sentiment": "negative", "summary_and_assessment": "The article maintains a relatively objective stance while covering an inherently disturbing topic.

In April, he won the Masters before going on to win gold at this year\u2019s Olympic Games in Paris. In total, Scheffler won seven events on the PGA Tour in 2024, including the TOUR Championship. \n\nScheffler also won the Hero World Challenge and helped lead Team USA to its tenth straight win at the Presidents Cup. \n\nScheffler won the 2024 Masters Tournament during a roller coaster year.\n\nWarren Little/Getty Images\n\nIt was an equally memorable year off the course for the Olympic Gold medalist.

All charges against the golfer were [later dismissed](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/29/us/scottie-scheffler-court-hearing/index.html). \n\nScheffler will be hard-pressed to ever have a more eventful year than he had in 2024, and his 2025 season will now be getting off to a much quieter start after his injury. \n\nScheffler expects to return to competition in mid-January at The American Express tournament at La Quinta, California, according to Smith. \n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n", "date": "2024-12-27T23:07:57Z", "topic": "sports", "bias": 15, "sentiment": "neutral", "summary_and_assessment": "The article provides a balanced and factual account of Scottie Scheffler's Christmas Day injury and its impact on his upcoming tournament schedule.

The bill gives wide latitude to the president to delay its enforcement if there\u2019s progress being made towards a deal that ensures TikTok isn\u2019t fully controlled by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. \n\nBut the deadline for that determination is January 19th, which is one day before Trump is set to be sworn in.\n\nIn his Supreme Court filing, Trump asks for the bill\u2019s January 19th deadline to be stayed, arguing that the deal he\u2019d negotiate \u201cwould obviate the need for this Court to decide the historically challenging First Amendment question presented here on the current, highly expedited basis.\u201d \n\nHe offers no details on what said deal would look like, though it would likely have to involve ByteDance selling a signification portion of its ownership in TikTok to an American company.\n\n### Related\n\n  * [The long-shot plan to save TikTok from a US ban](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320722/frank-mccourt-project-liberty-tiktok-us-ban-bytedance)\n  * [TikTok failed to save itself with the First Amendment](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316941/tiktok-divest-ban-court-ruling-breakdown-first-amendment)\n\n\n\nTrump argues that having over 14 million followers on TikTok, along with his ownership of Truth Social, gives him unique ability to \u201cevaluate TikTok\u2019s importance as a unique medium for freedom of expression, including core political speech.\u201d He also cites [Brazil\u2019s temporary ban of Elon Musk\u2019s X](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24232573/brazil-x-twitter-ban-elon-musk) as an example of \u201cthe historic dangers presented\u201d by a government banning a social media platform.\n\nWhile Trump [pushed aggressively for a TikTok ban](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445060/trump-tiktok-wechat-ban-us-apple-app-store-google-play-commerce-department) during his first term, he changed his tune after his campaign successfully used the video app during the 2024 election.

Kathy Hochul.\n\nHochul, a Democrat, signed the bill last week after it was passed by state lawmakers earlier this year.\n\nThe law requires state agencies to perform assessments of any software that uses algorithms, computational models or AI techniques, and then submit those reviews to the governor and top legislative leaders along with posting them online. \n\nIt also bars the use of AI in certain situations, such as an automated decision on whether someone receives unemployment benefits or child care assistance, unless the system is being consistently monitored by a human. \n\nState workers would also be shielded from having their hours or job duties limited because of AI under the law. \n\nState Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, a Democrat who sponsored the bill, called the law an important step in setting up some guardrails in how the emerging technology is used in state government. \n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * [Artificial Intelligence](/alerts/ArtificialIntelligence)\n  * [New York](/alerts/NewYork)\n\n\n\n## [US citizen sentenced by Moscow court on espionage charges, Russian media says\n\n  * Dec 27, 10:38 AM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-citizen-sentenced-15-years-moscow-court-espionage/story?id=117145877)\n\n## [Final crystal triangles installed on Times Square ball ahead of New Year's Eve\n\n  * Dec 27, 12:30 PM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/final-crystal-triangles-installed-times-square-ball-ahead-117152961)\n\n## [Mexico developing app for migrants in response to Trump's mass deportation plan\n\n  * Dec 27, 3:43 PM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/International/mexico-developing-app-migrants-send-alert-detained-us/story?id=117156045)\n\n## [Navy QB Horvath's 95-yard TD run in Armed Forces Bowl is longest in school history\n\n  * Dec 27, 11:48 AM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/navy-qb-blake-horvaths-95-yard-td-run-117152302)\n\n## [Man admits to setting fires at predominantly Black church in Rhode Island\n\n  * Dec 27, 12:00 PM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/man-admits-setting-fires-predominantly-black-church-rhode-117152406)\n\n### ABC News Live\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n\n## Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sale/Sharing\n\nSome states provide residents (or, in some cases, their authorized agents) with the right to opt out of \u201ctargeted advertising,\u201d \u201cselling,\u201d or \u201csharing\u201d of personal information.

Built by a young immigrant metalworker named Jacob Starr, the 700-pound (318-kilogram), 5-foot (1.52-meter) diameter ball was made of iron and wood and featured 100 25-watt light bulbs. Six newer versions of the ball have been featured in the century-plus since that first celebration.\n\nThe only years no ball drop occurred were 1942 and 1943, when the city instituted a nightly \u201cdimout\u201d during World War II to protect itself from attacks. Crowds instead celebrated the new year with a moment of silence followed by chimes rung from the base of One Times Square.\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * [New Year's](/alerts/NewYears)\n  * [New York](/alerts/NewYork)\n\n\n\n[](https://abcnews.go.com/US/pregnant-woman-stabbed-14-times-pizza-delivery-driver/story?id=117123714?id=117123714&cid=referral_taboola_feed)[Pregnant woman stabbed 14 times by pizza delivery driver over $2 tip: Police](https://abcnews.go.com/US/pregnant-woman-stabbed-14-times-pizza-delivery-driver/story?id=117123714?id=117123714&cid=referral_taboola_feed \"Pregnant woman stabbed 14 times by pizza delivery driver over $2 tip: Police\")\n\n[](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/trailblazing-model-dayle-haddon-dies-suspected-carbon-monoxide-117167637)[Trailblazing model Dayle Haddon dies from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/trailblazing-model-dayle-haddon-dies-suspected-carbon-monoxide-117167637 \"Trailblazing model Dayle Haddon dies from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning\")\n\n[](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/tiger-woods-wife-share-embrace-after-son-2nd/story?id=117097471)[Tiger Woods and ex-wife share embrace after he and son take 2nd place at golf tournament](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/tiger-woods-wife-share-embrace-after-son-2nd/story?id=117097471 \"Tiger Woods and ex-wife share embrace after he and son take 2nd place at golf tournament\")\n\n## [Missing dog returned to family home and rang the doorbell\n\n  * Dec 27, 10:58 AM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/missing-dog-returned-family-home-rang-doorbell-117151243)\n\n## [California man fatally shot by his parole officer, authorities say\n\n  * Dec 27, 5:54 PM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/california-man-fatally-shot-parole-officer-authorities-117158104)\n\n## ['Deeply concerned': Reagan FBI director urges caution against Trump appointees\n\n  * Dec 28, 10:30 AM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/reagan-fbi-director-urges-caution-gabbard-patel/story?id=117166000)\n\n## [Man admits to setting fires at predominantly Black church in Rhode Island\n\n  * Dec 27, 12:00 PM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/man-admits-setting-fires-predominantly-black-church-rhode-117152406)\n\n## [In states that ban abortion, social safety net programs often fail families\n\n  * Dec 27, 5:36 AM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/states-ban-abortion-social-safety-net-programs-fail-117139089)\n\n### ABC News Live\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n\n## Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sale/Sharing\n\nSome states provide residents (or, in some cases, their authorized agents) with the right to opt out of \u201ctargeted advertising,\u201d \u201cselling,\u201d or \u201csharing\u201d of personal information.

The fires caused property damage.\n\nA lawyer representing Colantonio declined to comment.\n\nWithout the quick action of first responders who arrived at the church at about 12:12 a.m. following reports of an individual trying to set fires, the damage to the house of worship would have been catastrophic, investigators said at the time.\n\nZachary Cunha, U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island, said at the time of that a search of his home turned up notebooks and writings that included phrases like \u201cburn churches down to the ground,\u201d \u201chunt them down,\u201d and \u201cgun everyone down who isn\u2019t white.\u201d\n\nThe plea agreement, which was filed in federal court last week, states that Colantonio intentionally targeted the church because of the \u201cactual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, and/or ethnicity of the congregants.\u201d\n\nMost of the Pentecostal congregation, which has been established for about 35 years, is Black and African American, according to investigators.\n\nNo injuries were reported.\n\nColantonio faces four counts: obstruction of the free exercise of religious beliefs; malicious damage by means of fire; and two counts of assault on a federal officer.\n\nIf served consecutively, Colantonio faces 56 years in prison, with a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years, a fine of $1 million and three years of supervised release.\n\nA change of plea hearing is scheduled for Jan. 7.\n\n[](https://abcnews.go.com/US/pregnant-woman-stabbed-14-times-pizza-delivery-driver/story?id=117123714?id=117123714&cid=referral_taboola_feed)[Pregnant woman stabbed 14 times by pizza delivery driver over $2 tip: Police](https://abcnews.go.com/US/pregnant-woman-stabbed-14-times-pizza-delivery-driver/story?id=117123714?id=117123714&cid=referral_taboola_feed \"Pregnant woman stabbed 14 times by pizza delivery driver over $2 tip: Police\")\n\n[](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/trailblazing-model-dayle-haddon-dies-suspected-carbon-monoxide-117167637)[Trailblazing model Dayle Haddon dies from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/trailblazing-model-dayle-haddon-dies-suspected-carbon-monoxide-117167637 \"Trailblazing model Dayle Haddon dies from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning\")\n\n[](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/tiger-woods-wife-share-embrace-after-son-2nd/story?id=117097471)[Tiger Woods and ex-wife share embrace after he and son take 2nd place at golf tournament](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/tiger-woods-wife-share-embrace-after-son-2nd/story?id=117097471 \"Tiger Woods and ex-wife share embrace after he and son take 2nd place at golf tournament\")\n\n## [California man fatally shot by his parole officer, authorities say\n\n  * Dec 27, 5:54 PM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/california-man-fatally-shot-parole-officer-authorities-117158104)\n\n## ['Deeply concerned': Reagan FBI director urges caution against Trump appointees\n\n  * Dec 28, 10:30 AM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/reagan-fbi-director-urges-caution-gabbard-patel/story?id=117166000)\n\n## ['Shocking scene' reported after Kilauea's latest eruption\n\n  * Dec 27, 9:55 AM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/kilauea-volcano-hawaii-safety/story?id=117140944)\n\n## [Woman sleeping in truck killed in explosion at Tyson Foods plant\n\n  * Dec 27, 1:13 PM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-sleeping-truck-killed-explosion-tyson-foods-plant/story?id=117153151)\n\n## ['Shocking' footage shows handcuffed inmate who died after prison guards beat him\n\n  * Dec 27, 4:23 PM\n\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/shocking-footage-shows-handcuffed-inmate-died-after-prison/story?id=117150189)\n\n### ABC News Live\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n\n## Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sale/Sharing\n\nSome states provide residents (or, in some cases, their authorized agents) with the right to opt out of \u201ctargeted advertising,\u201d \u201cselling,\u201d or \u201csharing\u201d of personal information.

It\u2019s pitted Trump\u2019s tech mogul donor class against his older network of far-right influencers like activist and while escalating into racist rhetoric against Indian Americans in particular. The ugly, extremely online fight between the American far-right influence network parallels the immigration debate currently .\n\nAnti-immigrant rhetoric was a cornerstone of Trump\u2019s pitch to voters; on top of promoting [false, racist rumors](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241487/trump-debate-haitian-migrants-cats-dogs-ohio) about immigrants and promising mass deportations that could , he\u2019s expected to revive [an H-1B visa crackdown](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22363047/trump-skilled-worker-visa-freeze-expired-president-biden) that he imposed during his first term. At the same time, Trump is leaning heavily on support from parts of Silicon Valley, which relies on the H-1B program for engineers and other skilled workers. Both these positions are represented in Trump\u2019s inner circle: Trump\u2019s homeland security advisor will be , for instance, while Sacks will shape tech policy and Musk and Ramaswamy will lead the unofficial \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d or DOGE.\n\n\u201cThese attacks have become crude, and not in the holiday spirit.\u201d\n\nThe inherent tension became obvious when Sacks announced Krishnan\u2019s appointment on X, then began fielding attacks from popular pro-Trump voices. Loomer, who joined Trump on the campaign trail, was \u201cdeeply disturbing,\u201d pointing to a Krishnan post asking DOGE to \u201cunlock skilled immigration.\u201d Another user\u2019s response, highlighted by Sacks, asked \u201cdid any of yall vote for this Indian to run America?\u201d Sacks \u201cSriram has been a U.S. citizen for a decade. He\u2019s not \u2018running America.\u2019 ... These attacks have become crude, and not in the holiday spirit.\u201d\n\nMusk and Ramaswamy then fueled the conflict by jumping in with praise of immigrant workers. (Musk himself, of course, immigrated to the US from South Africa under .) \u201cIf you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be,\u201d , implicitly supporting channels like the H-1B program. Musk said he would \u201cof course\u201d prefer to hire Americans than go through the \u201cpainful and slow\u201d work visa process, but \u201cthere is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America.\u201d\n\nRamaswamy that American pop culture like the \u201890s sitcom _Family Matters_ \u201cvenerated mediocrity over excellence.\u201d An X engineer escalated the situation \u201camerica wouldn\u2019t exist if it wasn\u2019t for Indian excellence\u201d in a series of posts Musk called \u201ca little over the top.\u201d\n\nConversely, figures like Loomer began tearing into Musk \u2014 questioning his claims about needing foreign workers, , and \u201ca total fucking drag on the Trump transition\u201d who \u201cover stayed his welcome at Mar a Lago in an effort to become Trump\u2019s side piece.\u201d\n\nTrouble in Musk\u2019s free speech paradise\n\nOver the past day the debate has shifted toward a new question: whether Musk has been from X\u2019s paid verification system, contradicting his frequent claims to have liberated X from the \u201ccensorship\u201d of moderation. have reported losing their verified status on the platform and being locked out of monetization options. (It\u2019s unclear whether Loomer will [once again handcuff herself](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/29/18118529/far-right-activist-laura-loomer-twitter-protest-handcuff-nyc-hq) to the company\u2019s headquarters in protest.) And Musk has that \u201cif far more credible, verified subscriber accounts (not bots) mute/block your account compared to those who like your posts, your reach will decline significantly.\u201d It\u2019s a not-so-subtle reminder that X is, Musk\u2019s promises of freedom notwithstanding, a private platform controlled by a fairly thin-skinned man.\n\nNone of the issues here are new, including the anti-Indian sentiments \u2014 Usha Vance, the Indian American wife of Trump\u2019s running mate JD Vance, on the campaign trail. They\u2019re newly relevant, though, as Trump prepares to take office and decide which faction\u2019s concerns he\u2019ll prioritize.\n\nFigures like Musk and Loomer once found common cause in attacking non-conservative \u201cBig Tech\u201d figures, and you can find artifacts of that alliance in this debate. Indian-born ex-Twitter executives Parag Agrawal and Vijaya Gadde, who were [targeted by Musk](https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/27/23044521/twitter-policy-chief-vijaya-gadde-elon-musk-policy-criticism-harassment) during his takeover, were dubbed examples of \u201cbad Indians\u201d by Indian American conservative commentator and Dinesh D\u2019Souza. (\u201cI\u2019m obviously one of the good ones,\u201d D\u2019Souza clarified.) Fundamentally, both sides are still hostile to immigration outside a select group of exceptions \u2014 Musk has even [promoted the spurious and antisemitic \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory](https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/25/24111405/elon-musk-great-replacement-conspiracy-immigration-don-lemon).\n\nBut in 2024, Big Tech CEOs have overwhelmingly signaled they\u2019ll [avoid antagonizing Trump](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320839/donald-trump-tim-cook-mar-a-lago), who could not only crack down on immigration but [eviscerate parts of the tech industry](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291333/second-trump-tech-policy-antitrust-ai-crypto) with tariffs. X, where the MAGA right tends to hang out online, has lost non-conservative users to platforms like Threads and Bluesky.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nThe United States saw an 18.1% increase in homelessness this year, a dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of as well as devastating natural disasters and a in several parts of the country, federal officials said Friday.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said federally required tallies taken across the country in January found that more than 770,000 people were counted as homeless \u2014 a number that misses some people and does not include those staying with friends or family because they do not have a place of their own.\n\nThat increase comes on top of a , which HUD blamed on soaring rents and the end of pandemic assistance. The 2023 increase also was driven by people experiencing homelessness for the first time. The numbers overall represent 23 of every 10,000 people in the U.S., with Black people being overrepresented among the homeless population.\n\n\u201cNo American should face homelessness, and the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring every family has access to the affordable, safe, and quality housing they deserve,\u201d HUD Agency Head Adrianne Todman said in a statement, adding that the focus should remain on \u201cevidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness.\u201d\n\nAmong the most concerning trends was a nearly 40% rise in family homelessness \u2014 one of the areas that was most affected by the arrival of . Family homelessness more than doubled in 13 communities impacted by migrants including Denver, Chicago and New York City, according to HUD, while it rose less than 8% in the remaining 373 communities. Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, reflecting a 33% jump from last year.\n\nDisasters also played a part in the rise in the count, especially last year's catastrophic Maui wildfire, the in more than a century. More than 5,200 people were staying in emergency shelters in Hawaii on the night of the count. \n\n\u201cIncreased homelessness is the tragic, yet predictable, consequence of underinvesting in the resources and protections that help people find and maintain safe, affordable housing,\u201d Renee Willis, incoming interim CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, in a statement. \u201cAs advocates, researchers, and people with lived experience have warned, the number of people experiencing homelessness continues to increase as more people struggle to afford sky-high housing costs.\u201d\n\nRobert Marbut Jr., the former executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness from 2019 to 2021, called the nearly 33% increase in homelessness over the past four years \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and said the federal government needs to abandon efforts to prioritize permanent housing.\n\n\u201cWe need to focus on treatment of substance use and mental illness, and bring back program requirements, like job training,\u201d Marbut said in an email.\n\nThe numbers also come as increasing are taking a hard line against homelessness. \n\nCommunities \u2014 especially in Western states \u2014 have been enforcing bans on camping as public pressure grows to address what some residents say are dangerous and unsanitary living conditions. That follows a that found that outdoor sleeping bans don\u2019t violate the Eighth Amendment. Homeless advocates argued that punishing people who need a place to sleep would criminalize homelessness.\n\nThere was some positive news in the count, as continued to trend downwards. Homelessness among veterans dropped 8% to 32,882 in 2024. It was an even larger decrease for unsheltered veterans, declining 11% to 13,851 in 2024. \n\n\u201cThe reduction in veteran homelessness offers us a clear roadmap for addressing homelessness on a larger scale,\u201d Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a statement. \u201cWith bipartisan support, adequate funding, and smart policy solutions, we can replicate this success and reduce homelessness nationwide. Federal investments are critical in tackling the country\u2019s housing affordability crisis and ensuring that every American has access to safe, stable housing.\u201d\n\nSeveral large cities had success bringing down their homeless numbers. Dallas, which worked to overhaul its homeless system, saw a 16% drop in its numbers between 2022 to 2024. Los Angeles, which increased housing for the homeless, saw a drop of 5% in unsheltered homelessness since 2023. California, the most populous state in the U.S., continued to have the nation's largest homeless population, followed by New York, Washington, Florida and Massachusetts.\n\nThe sharp increase in the homeless population over the past two years contrasts with success the U.S. had been having for more than a decade.\n\nGoing back to the first 2007 survey, the U.S. made steady progress for about a decade in reducing the homeless population as the government focused particularly on increasing investments to get veterans into housing. The number of homeless people dropped from about 637,000 in 2010 to about 554,000 in 2017.\n\nThe numbers ticked up to about 580,000 in the 2020 count and held relatively steady over the next two years as Congress responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with , stimulus payments, and a temporary .\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that the Supreme Court ruling that found that outdoor sleeping bans don\u2019t violate the Eighth Amendment was this year, not last year.\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * [Economy](/alerts/Economy)\n  * [Real Estate](/alerts/RealEstate)\n\n\n\n[](https://abcnews.go.com/US/pregnant-woman-stabbed-14-times-pizza-delivery-driver/story?id=117123714?id=117123714&cid=referral_taboola_feed)[Pregnant woman stabbed 14 times by pizza delivery driver over $2 tip: Police](https://abcnews.go.com/US/pregnant-woman-stabbed-14-times-pizza-delivery-driver/story?id=117123714?id=117123714&cid=referral_taboola_feed \"Pregnant woman stabbed 14 times by pizza delivery driver over $2 tip: Police\")\n\n[](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/trailblazing-model-dayle-haddon-dies-suspected-carbon-monoxide-117167637)[Trailblazing model Dayle Haddon dies from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/trailblazing-model-dayle-haddon-dies-suspected-carbon-monoxide-117167637 \"Trailblazing model Dayle Haddon dies from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning\")\n\n[](https://abcnews.go.com/family/story/tiger-woods-wife-share-embrace-after-son-2nd/?id=117097471&id=117097471&cid=referral_taboola_feed)[Tiger Woods and ex-wife share embrace after he and son take 2nd place at golf tournament](https://abcnews.go.com/family/story/tiger-woods-wife-share-embrace-after-son-2nd/?id=117097471&id=117097471&cid=referral_taboola_feed \"Tiger Woods and ex-wife share embrace after he and son take 2nd place at golf tournament\")\n\n## [Norovirus cases are on the rise in the US.

Instead of going through every single one of the specs and pixel-peeping every photo I\u2019ve taken over the past month, I\u2019ve picked the top three photos that have taught me something about the new Canon R5.

Games like [_Metaphor: ReFantazio_](https://www.theverge.com/games/2023/12/7/23992947/metaphor-refantazio-looks-sick), [_Astro Bot_](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24237166/astro-bots-roll-out), and the solo-developed [_Balatro_](https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame) remixed genres of console generations past (or, in _Balatro_ \u2019s case, remixed the very old game of poker itself) to critical and commercial success, while Capcom was one of the most successful companies of the year supported by a healthy mix of titles across different genres. With the industry\u2019s biggest publishers [increasingly chasing massive, broadly appealing games meant to be played forever](https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite), it was heartening to see old formats come back with some new tricks. And these successes could provide the blueprint needed to pull the video game industry out of its current tailspin.\n\nImage: Atlus\n\n _Persona_ developer Atlus has once again innovated on the turn-based RPG with [_Metaphor: ReFantazio_](https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona). What makes _Metaphor_ \u2019s combat interesting in a way that\u2019s hard to replicate with traditional turn-based RPGs is that Atlus has built a unique ability system powered by anticipation and anxiety. Characters have access to powerful summons, each with their own abilities, along with strengths and weaknesses that enemies also share. Hitting an enemy\u2019s weakness or having your own exploited results in monumental shifts in the momentum of battle. Every attack becomes consequential, as you don\u2019t know what will work against your foes or what they have to work against you.\n\nAtlus has built a unique ability system powered by anticipation and anxiety.\n\nDespite dominating with games like _Final Fantasy_ in the late \u201980s and through the \u201990s, turn-based RPGs have largely been left behind. (With [the notable exception of the _Dragon Quest_ series](https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review), which consistently sells beaucoup copies in Japan.) [Modern tastes](https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/23/23180709/final-fantasy-16-eikons-naoki-yoshida-interview) have evolved to prefer the active, frenetic, and combo-dependent combat of the action RPG over the passive, implied action of turn-based games. But through the [_Persona_ series](https://www.theverge.com/23553499/persona-p3-p4-review-switch-ps4-xbox), and now with _Metaphor_ , Atlus has proven it is uniquely equipped to make turn-based RPGs feel just as kinetic and engaging as their action-based cousins.\n\nImage: Playstack\n\n[The poker roguelike _Balatro_](https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack) is perhaps the game that best represents the success that can be had by melding old genres with new features. [Roguelikes can be a difficult sell](https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc), especially to players unfamiliar with the genre. To get them to stick, players not only have to be okay with the idea of failure as progression but also have to be invested enough in the game\u2019s wider world to want to keep playing through it multiple times. For every [_Hades_](https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc), there are hundreds of games on digital storefronts that blur together into smears of generic fantasy dungeon crawlers. \n\n[Balatro is] catnip for the players who can\u2019t resist \u201cnumber go up.\u201d \n\nOne of the reasons _Balatro_ became an instant success was because it didn\u2019t have that hurdle. Poker is known all over the world and hasn\u2019t really changed much in the centuries since its invention._Balatro_ took advantage of that familiarity and combined it with great humor and an that made it catnip for the players who can\u2019t resist \u201cnumber go up.\u201d More than that, _Balatro_ feels more permissive than its roguelike cousins. The best runs in _Hades_ are typically the result of lucking into specific boons or items, whereas _Balatro_ is lousy with jokers, card modifiers, perks, and more that make scores get stupid fast. _Balatro_ took home a slew of Game Awards, and it probably would have won Game of the Year if not for that one meddling robot.\n\nImage: Team Asobi\n\nSpeaking of\u2026 perhaps the biggest example of 2024\u2019s Return trend is [_Astro Bot_](https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year). Developed by Team Asobi, _Astro Bot_ is a full-sized, standalone expansion of the PS5 pack-in game [_Astro\u2019s Playroom_](https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller) that takes the little robot\u2019s adventures beyond the confines of the PS5 console and into the wider universe. At its core, though, _Astro Bot is_ a mascot platformer reminiscent of the games from PlayStation\u2019s earliest days like _Crash Bandicoot_ and _Spyro the Dragon_. Indeed, _Astro Bot_ pays homage to those very characters, featuring them as robots to rescue along with other characters from PlayStation\u2019s 30-year history. \n\n _Astro Bot_ is stuffed with so many items and secrets to collect. That kind of mechanic can get tedious in games suited to \u201cmodern\u201d tastes like _Assassin\u2019s Creed_ , as finding things feels no better than ticking off a box in the slow march to 100 percent completion. But each of Astro\u2019s powers \u2014 like the dog jetpack or the shrinking mouse \u2014 inject whimsy into the act of collecting. And when I do find a secret, I\u2019m rewarded with a little celebration of cheering bots that somehow never gets old.\n\nMascot platformers fell out of favor, especially with PlayStation studios, despite initial success. Naughty Dog and Sucker Punch have transitioned away from the lightheartedness of Crash Bandicoot and Sly Cooper to make \u201c[serious](https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5)\u201d games for \u201c[mature](https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai)\u201d audiences, and PlayStation\u2019s recent catalog reflects that overall trend. _Astro Bot_ is an outlier in form and tone and parlayed that uniqueness into a shower of accolades. It would be such a missed opportunity if Sony didn\u2019t respond to that success with similar projects.\n\nWhen I do find a secret, I\u2019m rewarded with a little celebration of cheering bots that somehow never gets old.\n\nOver the last two years, [prolific layoffs](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163110/embracer-laid-off-more-employees-than-riot-games-entire-workforce) and [studio closures](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios) have left tens of thousands of developers unemployed, in large part because companies [spent too much money](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/18/23311082/embracer-group-acquisition-lord-of-the-rings-hobbit-limited-run-games-tripwire) [on getting bigger](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized) or [developing huge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games), that may have made sense years ago but no longer do. Companies dumped hundreds of millions of dollars and considerable development resources into the next live-service shooter in hopes of replicating _Fortnite_ and _Call of Duty_ \u2019s runaway success and profits. But as those games continue to top the monthly video game spending charts, refreshed by a steady cadence of new content, the idea that a newcomer like [_XDefiant_ could compete at that same level](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds) becomes increasingly remote. This leaves studios with an expensive product nobody wants to play, along with a pipeline of upcoming games too sparse to make up the difference.\n\nImage: Capcom\n\nBut the way out of this precipitous (and avoidable) decline doesn\u2019t necessarily mean giving up on the big multiplayer or open-world projects. Capcom, for example, has proven that \u201cpor qu\u00e9 no los dos\u201d can be a winning strategy. The company has boasted record profits with a diverse catalog composed of heavy hitters like _Monster Hunter_ , _Resident Evil_ remakes, and _Street Fighter,_ along with smaller, weirder games like [_Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2_](https://www.theverge.com/23979909/dragons-dogma-2-release-date-trailer-capcom) and [_Kunitsu-gami: Path of The Goddess_](https://www.theverge.com/24202033/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-capcom). Contrast that with Square Enix after it to [make _Foamstars_ happen](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24040124/square-enix-foamstars-ai-art-midjourney) on top of releasing [three](https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5) [different](https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5) [AAA _Final Fantasy_ titles](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24030282/final-fantasy-14-new-class-pictomancer-ffxiv-fan-fest-tokyo) in a 12-month period. Capcom has the right idea , stating that it plans on \u201cre-activating dormant IPs that haven\u2019t had a new title launch recently\u201d after revealing new entries in its [_Okami_](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320133/okami-2-announce-game-awards)and [_Onimusha_](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320142/onimusha-is-back-and-very-bloody) series.\n\nBut more than just appealing to gamer nostalgia, these success stories \u2014 which also extend to [survival horror](https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox) and [Metroidvanias](https://www.theverge.com/24035933/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft) \u2014 offer a healthier alternative to the trends the big publishers and studios are pursuing. (Nintendo, of course, is always exempt from these generalizations.) While there will always be an appetite for big online shooters or bespoke open-world games with hours of Hollywood-acted voice and motion performance, these breakout releases of 2024 prove (or should at least remind decision-makers) that there is so much worth to also be found in smaller, quirkier, and most importantly, cheaper projects. If the big publishers want to staunch the bleeding of the last two miserable years, they could take the lessons Capcom, _Balatro_ , _Metaphor,_ and _Astro Bot_ provide.\n\nComments5 Comments / 5 New\n\n## More from this stream [The Verge\u2019s 2024 in review](/24305538/2024-best-worst-streaming-gaming-tech-list-roundup)\n\n  * ### [10 terrific Nintendo Switch games from 2024 to check out](/24317154/nintendo-switch-best-games-2024-top-10-goty)\n\nDec 28, 2024, 6:00 AM PST\n\n  * ### [9 great Game Pass games for your Xbox](/24317923/xbox-game-pass-best-games-2024-microsoft-pc)\n\nDec 27, 2024, 7:00 AM PST\n\n  * ### [The best shows and movies on Netflix in 2024](/24322728/netflix-best-shows-movies-2024-streaming)\n\nDec 26, 2024, 7:00 AM PST\n\n  * ### [Even Apple wasn\u2019t able to make VR headsets mainstream in 2024](/24303262/apple-vision-pro-vr-mainstream-meta-glasses)\n\nDec 26, 2024, 6:00 AM PST\n\n\n[See all 19 stories](/24305538/2024-best-worst-streaming-gaming-tech-list-roundup)\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT\n", "date": "2024-12-27T14:00:00Z", "topic": "technology", "bias": 25, "sentiment": "positive", "summary_and_assessment": "The article provides an insightful analysis of 2024's gaming landscape, highlighting how traditional gaming formats have found renewed success in modern times.

But both the Japanese gaming giant and the broader gaming industry typically leave Let\u2019s Plays alone, because they serve as free marketing for their games.\n\nAnd yet, YouTube had received a legit-looking request apparently justifying these takedowns under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), signed \u201cTatsumi Masaaki, Nintendo Legal Department, Nintendo of America.\u201d\n\nIt was in a second email from YouTube that Domtendo spotted something off. The takedown requests came from a _personal_ account at an encrypted email service: \u201ctatsumi-masaaki@protonmail.com\u201d.\n\n_YouTube took action on Domtendo\u2019s videos, even though the requests cited a personal email address._ Image: Domtendo\n\nFake takedowns are real. over six percent of takedown requests through its public webform are likely fake, and the company accepts requests via plain email too, meaning anyone can file them. Fighting fake takedowns can cost creators time, money, and stress. But creators can\u2019t easily be sure that a takedown is fake \u2014 and they can lose their entire channel if they get it wrong and clash with a company that has a legitimate copyright claim.\n\n[When the well-respected Retro Game Corps](https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike) received his second Nintendo copyright strike, he publicly declared he would self-censor all his future work to hopefully escape the company\u2019s wrath. But first, he checked that Nintendo\u2019s threat was real. He checked to see who YouTube listed as the complaining party, and that it came from a Nintendo email address. Then he checked with his YouTube Partner Manager to be extra safe.\n\n### Related\n\n  * [Why is Nintendo targeting this YouTuber?](https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike)\n  * [Garry\u2019s Mod is taking down decades of Nintendo-related add-ons](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/25/24140246/garrys-mod-nintendo-copyright-takedowns-dmca)\n\n\n\nRumors of fake Nintendo takedowns have swirled in the past. Earlier this year, _Garry\u2019s Mod_ developer Garry Newman removed[ 20 years\u2019 worth of Nintendo-related fan content from his sandbox video game](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/25/24140246/garrys-mod-nintendo-copyright-takedowns-dmca) over takedown threats. Fans speculated that it may actually have been someone posing as a Nintendo lawyer. But Newman eventually revealed despite using seemingly suspicious names and emails.\n\nDomtendo thought he might have an actual case of a Nintendo faker. So he decided to push back. At first, it seemed to work. He emailed YouTube, and it soon reinstated his videos. But Tatsumi was back the next day \u2014 this time, emailing Domtendo directly. \n\n\u201cDear Domtendo, I represent Nintendo of America Inc. (\u201cNintendo\u201d) in intellectual property matters,\u201d the first email began. After a bunch of legalese, Tatsumi eventually explains why he\u2019s reaching out: \u201cI submitted a notice through YouTube\u2019s legal copyright system, but the infringing content still appears.\u201d\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t let it go. \n\nDomtendo wasn\u2019t about to risk his livelihood just in case Tatsumi was real. He got spooked, and began voluntarily pulling his videos off YouTube. But his new pen pal just kept asking for more removals. Tatsumi reached out day after day, sometimes multiple times a day, according to emails shared with _The Verge_. The threats got weirder, too:\n\n**October 3rd:**\n\n> I ask for your expeditious removal of all infringing material that use Nintendo Switch game emulators by 6th October 2024. Please note that the amount of videos infringing Nintendo\u2019s copyrights is too high to be able to list them all in this e-mail and we hope that you will conscientiously remove all infringing videos before the next week. \n\n**October 8th:**\n\n> Nintendo hereby prohibits you from any future use of its intellectual and copyrighted property. Existing content may remain as long as there is no request to remove it. Nintendo of America Inc. would like to avoid further legal action and therefore hopes that their intellectual property will no longer be used by you. This cease-and-desist declaration is valid immediately and has been approved by President of Nintendo of America Doug Spencer Bowser.\n\n**October 12th:**\n\n> Nintendo of America Inc. (\u201cNintendo\u201d) will no longer tolerate this behavior and is now on the verge of filing a lawsuit. Note that we work closely with our subsidiary Nintendo of Europe, located in Germany and therefore already have your address from the time you have been Nintendo Partner and/or will receive your new address from the residents\u2019 registration office.\u201d\n\nDomtendo began reaching out to friends and fellow content creators, and discovered he wasn\u2019t alone. , a streamer who develops Zelda mods, had been targeted by Tatsumi as well. Only that time, the takedown notices were filed in Japanese, and YouTube claimed they\u2019d come from a seemingly real email address: . Whoever submitted those notices claimed to be a \u201cGroup Sub-Manager\u201d in Nintendo\u2019s \u201cIntellectual Property Department.\u201d \n\nCould Tatsumi be legit? Was Domtendo staring down a real threat? \n\n _The Verge_ could find no public record of a Tatsumi Masaaki working for Nintendo of America or Nintendo\u2019s legal team, period. Nintendo did not respond to _The Verge_ \u2019s repeated requests to fact-check whether such a lawyer even exists. \n\nBut there _was_ a person by a similar name in its home country of Japan, public records show, and Domtendo was dismayed to find a Nintendo email address for that person on the public web. \n\n _This is the name of a real person (_ \u771f\u7ae0 \u8fb0\u5df1) _who worked for Nintendo out of Kyoto, Japan_ , _but the company wouldn\u2019t tell The Verge one word about it._ Image: USPTO\n\nTo a trained eye, there were signs that Domtendo\u2019s \u201cTatsumi\u201d was probably a fake. What business would a Japanese game technology inventor have individually chasing down a German YouTuber and threatening them with the laws of the United States? If they were a real lawyer, wouldn\u2019t they know that threatening Domtendo with DMCA 512 is laughable, because that\u2019s the portion of the law that protects platforms like YouTube rather than individual creators? \n\nBut Domtendo didn\u2019t want to take the risk, not without proof. His livelihood was at stake. So as Tatsumi\u2019s email threats rolled in, he reached out to Nintendo himself. \n\nTo his great surprise, Nintendo replied. \n\n\u201cPlease note that is not a legitimate Nintendo email address and the details contained within the communication do not align with Nintendo of America Inc.\u2019s enforcement practices. We are investigating further,\u201d the company\u2019s legal department wrote on October 10th, according to a screenshot shared with _The Verge_.\n\n_Here\u2019s how Nintendo replied to Domtendo._\n\nEven then, Domtendo didn\u2019t feel safe. He\u2019d seen how Waikuteru had received a legal threat that seemingly came from a legitimate Nintendo email. Perhaps Tatsumi just wasn\u2019t using his proper email account? Domtendo tried emailing \u201ctasumi_masaaki@nintendo.co.jp\u201d to find out. \n\nHis anxiety ratcheted even higher when Tatsumi\u2019s next email arrived, asking him not to send email to that address. \u201cPlease understand that matters are not currently handled from there,\u201d he wrote. Even though it seemed impossible that Tatsumi could be real, he somehow knew things that he shouldn\u2019t.\n\nThen, on October 18th, Tatsumi suddenly changed his tune: \u201cDear Domtendo, I hereby retract all of my preceding claims.\u201d\n\n _The end?_\n\nTatsumi wasn\u2019t done with Domtendo quite yet. Two more emails arrived the same day, explaining that while Nintendo had \u201csuspended\u201d him from filing copyright infringement claims, his Nintendo colleagues would now file them on his behalf. Hours later, Domtendo received what was in some ways the most legit-looking email yet, seemingly sent from anti-piracy3@nintendo.co.jp rather than a personal email address. \n\nBut that email turned out to be Tatsumi\u2019s undoing, when Domtendo checked the headers and discovered they\u2019d spoofed Nintendo\u2019s email address using a publicly available tool on the web. I took the tool for a spin, and sure enough \u2014 , anyone can make an email look like it was sent from Nintendo that way. \n\nDomtendo still doesn\u2019t understand how \u201cTatsumi\u201d knew he\u2019d emailed the real Tatsumi at Nintendo. He changed his passwords and reformatted his computer, just to be safe. Today, his best guess is that the troll was lurking in his personal Discord channel. \n\nHe\u2019s angry at YouTube for letting this happen. \u201cIt\u2019s their fault,\u201d he tells me. \u201cEvery idiot can strike every YouTuber and there is nearly no problem to do so. It\u2019s insane,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt has to change NOW.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery idiot can strike every YouTuber\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true there isn\u2019t a terribly high bar to submit a YouTube copyright claim, something that YouTube itself admits. Currently, bad actors just need to fill in a form on a website, a place where YouTube sees a \u201c10 times higher attempted abuse rate\u201d than tools with more limited access. Or they can just email YouTube\u2019s copyright department directly. And while technically requires a copyright holder to provide their name and address and state \u201cunder penalty of perjury\u201d that they\u2019re authorized to complain on Nintendo\u2019s behalf, there\u2019s nothing compelling YouTube to check they aren\u2019t lying before slapping creators with penalties. \n\n## [Why is Nintendo targeting this YouTuber?](https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike)\n\nRuss Crandall, aka Retro Game Corps, was actually targeted by Nintendo. [Here\u2019s the story](https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike) of how the Japanese game company (and YouTube) are threatening his livelihood.\n\nIf you have first-hand information about Nintendo, you can reach me securely on Signal at **seanhollister.01**. \n\nThe thing to remember is the DMCA\u2019s \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d isn\u2019t here to protect creators, EFF legal director Corynne McSherry explained to me in 2022. When rightsholders realized they wouldn\u2019t be able to sue every uploader, and internet platforms realized they wouldn\u2019t be able to survive under an onslaught of uploader lawsuits, the law became a compromise to protect platforms from liability as long as they remove infringing content fast. \n\n\u201cIt creates a situation where service providers have very strong incentives to respond,\u201d said McSherry. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to mess around and try to figure out if they might be liable or not.\u201d\n\nWaikuteru and Rimea, a pair of other creators harassed by Tatsumi, agree that the YouTube system is unfair. Neither know for sure whether trolls were responsible for all the takedown notices they\u2019re received, and that\u2019s part of the problem. \u201cThe idea that months of worries were caused by a single troll as opposed to a big untouchable company is a hard pill to swallow either way,\u201d says Rimea. \n\nBut they also claim YouTube doesn\u2019t allow smaller channels to challenge copyright strikes in the first place, arguing that it automatically and arbitrarily rejects the legal notices that would let them reinstate their videos. \u201cYouTube decides whether someone loses his channel based on channel size,\u201d says Waikuteru. \n\nYouTube isn\u2019t particularly interested in talking about any of this, though. \n\nWhile YouTube spokesperson Jack Malon did confirm that \u201cTatsumi\u201d made false claims, the company wouldn\u2019t explain why the company even briefly accepted false claims from a protonmail.com email address as legitimate, and repeatedly dodged questions about whether Tatsumi made false claims on other creators\u2019 videos, too. \n\nYouTube wouldn\u2019t even tell me whether Domtendo was still in danger of false copyright claims from this specific individual, or offer assurances that it would take any new action to prevent this sort of behavior in the future. \n\nMalon does claim that YouTube has \u201cdedicated teams working to detect and prevent abuse,\u201d however, and \u201cwork to ensure that any associated strikes are reversed\u201d when bad actors make false claims. \n\nAs for the troll, Tatsumi declined _The Verge_ \u2019s interview request. \u201cDear Sean, I am an authorized agent for Nintendo of America Inc,\u201d they replied, staying in character to the very end. \n\nComments27 Comments / 27 New\n\n## More from [Gaming](/games)\n\n  * ### [10 terrific Nintendo Switch games from 2024 to check out](/24317154/nintendo-switch-best-games-2024-top-10-goty)\n\n  * ### [9 great Game Pass games for your Xbox](/24317923/xbox-game-pass-best-games-2024-microsoft-pc)\n\n  * ### [2024\u2019s best games channeled the heart and soul of the \u201890s](/24325371/2024s-best-games-classic-genres-astro-bot-balatro-metaphor)\n\n  * ### [The 2TB WD_Black C50 expansion card for Xbox Series X/S hits record low $190](/2024/12/26/24329530/western-digital-2tb-wd-black-c50-expansion-card-umbra-cono-smart-lamp-deal-sale)\n\n\n\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT\n\nSubscribe and get a limited edition magazine shipped to your door.

The goal for Directive known colloquially as the common charging solution, is to reduce e-waste and solve market fragmentation. You may recall Apple and the EU butting heads over this [a few years ago](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23423977/iphone-usb-c-eu-law-joswiak-confirms-compliance-lightning).\n\nThe requirement for USB-C is just the surface of this directive though. It also includes regulations on fast charging, unbundling charging bricks from retail devices, and the introduction of improved labelling \u2014 and it has the potential to make life for gadget enthusiasts in the EU a whole lot simpler. If it works, of course.\n\nTo begin, some background. EU countries and parliament came to a provisional agreement on the common charging solution on June 7th, 2022. The legislation was formally approved in . After it was given the green light by the council, countries had until December 28th, 2024 to merge these into their , at which point companies operating inside the bloc must abide by them.\n\n### Freedom\u2026 to use USB-C\n\nThe sheer breadth of this directive means its impact will be felt by both consumers and businesses, as the common charging solution applies to anything as radio equipment. This, it states, is an electrical or electronic product that intentionally emits or receives radio waves for the purpose of \u201ccommunication and/or radiodetermination.\u201d\n\nhandheld mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, headphones, headsets, handheld videogame consoles, portable speakers, e-readers, keyboards, mice, portable navigation systems, and earbuds that are \u201crechargeable with a wired cable and can operate with a power delivery of up to 100 watts.\u201d\n\nA PlayStation 5, for example, has , meaning it won\u2019t fall under the directive. The Nintendo Switch draws up to 6W in TV mode, meaning it will. The only current exception to this definition are , which have until April 28, 2026, to comply with the directive.\n\nThere are grey areas though. Drones, for example, aren\u2019t on the list, and it\u2019s unclear if they fit into other categories like digital cameras. In instances like this, it will \u201ccontinuously assess market developments, market fragmentation, and technological progress\u201d with the aim of keeping this list of devices as relevant and up-to-date as possible.\n\nWireless charging also isn\u2019t covered by the directive. For now, the Commission \u201cpromote the harmonization\u201d of the practice to \u201cavoid future fragmentation of the internal market and any negative effects on consumers and the environment.\u201d What shape this may take is anyone\u2019s guess, but the EU has it on the radar.\n\nDespite these pools of murkiness, the key point is the majority of consumer-facing tech in the EU must be equipped with a \u201c.\u201d Although, this only applies to the device side, as charging brick connections aren\u2019t covered in this directive. \n\nGoodnight Lightning. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nStill, for the average user, there won\u2019t be a heap of change come December 28th around charging inputs. The majority of devices on the market that fall under this directive already use USB-C. Even Apple, the big holdout with its [Lightning technology](https://www.theverge.com/23312359/apple-iphone-lightning-cable-anniversary-10-years), shifted to the format on [_most_ of its devices](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24275569/apple-usb-c-magic-keyboard-mouse-trackpad-no-lightning) \u2014 more on that in a second.\n\nAn interesting wrinkle in this regulation is the EU hasn\u2019t actually banned proprietary charging ports. Instead, hardware just needs the ability to charge via USB-C. This means the current MacBook range with [MagSafe](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733119/apple-new-macbook-pro-magsafe-back) is compliant, as you can charge them with both Apple\u2019s magnetic connector and the EU\u2019s chosen tech.\n\n### Impact on sales\n\nSo what happens if a device that falls under the common charger directive is being sold in the bloc _without_ a USB-C charging port? In most cases, even if it was released before the December 28th deadline, it can\u2019t be sold. For example, Apple is gearing up to remove the iPhone 14, iPhone SE, and the Magic Keyboard without TouchID \u2014 the final devices it sells with a Lightning charging port \u2014 from its retail portfolio in the EU as it has [already done in Switzerland](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24325893/apple-usb-c-eu-iphone-se-iphone-14-iphone-14-plus).\n\nThere are exceptions to this though. When it comes to products that are already in circulation, devices without USB-C ports that are placed on the market for the first time before December 28th can still be sold within the EU.\n\nThe governing bloc, , defines being \u201cplaced on the market\u201d as the moment when a manufacturer or importer supplies a product to a distributor or an end-user for the first time. \u201cManufacturers, importers and distributors need to be given time to exercise any rights they have acquired under any pre-existing, national or EU rules,\u201d the European Commission states, \u201cfor example to sell their stocks of products manufactured in line with the pre-existing rules.\u201d\n\nIn other words, much of the pre-existing stock can be sold if it is already owned by a retailer, although the store won\u2019t be able to purchase any more units. We may find retailers being cautious though, and simply removing the hardware from sale, or shifting it to markets where the regulations aren\u2019t in force.\n\n### Fast charging, but make it simpler\n\nAnother important, but less well-known, aspect of the common charging directive is around the unification of fast charging. The EU\u2019s goal being the simplification of this oft-confusing practice. The governing body defines fast charging as anything that can be recharged via a wire with \u201cvoltages higher than 5 volts, currents higher than 3 amperes, or powers higher than 15 watts.\u201d \n\nWhen devices hit this threshold, they must work with USB Power Delivery (USB PD), a charging protocol that enables devices to transfer power over USB in addition to data. While some devices, such as iPhones and the Google Pixel range , other handsets, such as OnePlus and OPPO, use the proprietary charging SUPERVOOC standard without also supporting USB PD.\n\nThis directive aims to ensure that devices that offer fast charging are compatible with any charger. Consumers, then, should be able to power up their hardware at the maximum speed the charging equipment supports. The key element here is that the full functionality of USB PD must be enabled and not hampered by any other charging protocol. \n\nFor consumers, the field of fast charging will probably remain confusing in the short term, but as the hardware people already own is slowly replaced, the directive should make this process simpler in the future.\n\n### To bundle or not to bundle (charging bricks)\n\nThe third part of the common charging solution is, , giving consumers the chance to \u201cpurchase a new electronic device without a new charger.\u201d Its aim is to stop excessive waste resulting from buyers owning too many duplicate chargers that go unused.\n\nOn the surface, this won\u2019t be a hassle for many companies. Apple [stopped selling its iPhones](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions) and [other devices](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455726/apple-removes-charging-brick-watch-edition-hermes-model-environment) with charging bricks some time ago, a trend that\u2019s been [repeated](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628702/google-pixel-6-charger-not-included) across the industry. For consumers, this will be one of the bigger changes. \n\nThe days of receiving a charger with every purchase of an electronic device in the EU are over, and it\u2019s bound to lead to some confusion, with people expecting a wall brick with their new device and not receiving one. Over time though, the public will adapt \u2014 especially with the help of the final part of the directive.\n\nSpecifically, this is the introduction of a new visual language for charging. The first example is self-explanatory, with a graphic showing whether or not there\u2019s a charging brick in the box:\n\n_Pictograms showing whether a charger is or is not included in the box. Although companies can choose their own design, these icons will have to be shown for every relevant purchase._ Image: European Commission\n\nThe second pictogram could actually help people get a grasp on what their devices are capable of in terms of receiving power. The outline looks like this, where \u201cXX\u201d is the minimum amount of power needed for the device to charge, while \u201cYY\u201d is the maximum, and \u201cUSB PD\u201d will be displayed if the hardware can support that protocol:\n\n_A new pictogram will help buyers understand the charging characteristics of their new device. It will vary slightly by manufacturer so long as it communicates the basics._ Image: European Commission\n\nWhile the introduction of this visual language is a simple idea, it will help educate users about powering, as well as helping to tie many of the above regulations together.\n\n### Now what?\n\nThe elephant in the room is how the common charging solution is actually enforced. This will be down to , as they\u2019re responsible for performing market surveillance. \n\nEach nation will be able to use a variety of measures, including fines and the forced withdrawal of the non-compliant equipment. The issue is how these bodies will manage and verify the huge influx of cheap technology coming from outside the bloc. While big hitters like Samsung or Apple will comply, as they know they\u2019ll have regulators\u2019 eyes on them, it\u2019s harder to ascertain whether smaller businesses will adapt as quickly or receive the same level of scrutiny.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s hard to view the common charging solution as anything other than a good thing for those inside the EU. Although the transition to USB-C already had a lot of momentum, one can argue that this shift was accelerated by the regulations, [especially in Apple\u2019s case](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22690338/apple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe). \n\nThe directive is untested, however, and it remains to be seen how nimble it can be adapted in the face of new device categories and the development of improved charging solutions and interfaces. This, in a way, is the microcosm of regulators\u2019 continued battle with tech: how the slow-moving process of lawmaking handles an industry whose only constant is change.\n\nComments76 Comments / 76 New\n\n## More from [Policy](/policy)\n\n  * ### [Eddy Cue explains why Apple won\u2019t make a search engine](/2024/12/26/24329148/apple-eddy-cue-search-engine-ai-google-doj-antitrust-intervene)\n\n  * ### [Marriott and Starwood hotels will have to get better at data security](/2024/12/23/24328437/ftc-marriott-international-starwood-hotels-order-data-security-cyberattacks-hacks-ransomware)\n\n  * ### [Google to court: we\u2019ll change our Apple deal, but please let us keep Chrome](/2024/12/23/24328087/google-proposed-final-judgement-search-monopoly-antitrust-default-contracts)\n\n  * ### [Walmart sued over illegally opening bank accounts for delivery drivers](/2024/12/23/24328046/walmart-spark-delivery-lawsuit-branch-instant-payment)\n\n\n\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT\n\nUndo\n\nno reason\n\nThank you for your feedback\n\nWe'll try not to show you this content\n\nUndo\n\nno reason\n\nThank you for your feedback\n\nWe'll try not to show you this content\n\nUndo\n\nno reason\n\nThank you for your feedback\n\nWe'll try not to show you this content\n\nUndo\n\nno reason\n\nThank you for your feedback\n\nWe'll try not to show you this content\n\nUndo\n\nno reason\n\nThank you for your feedback\n\nWe'll try not to show you this content\n\nUndo\n\nno reason\n\nThank you for your feedback\n\nWe'll try not to show you this content\n\nSubscribe and get a limited edition magazine shipped to your door.

Here\u2019s what we know ](/2024/12/26/asia/kazakhstan-plane-crash-questions-intl)\n\nRussia said on Friday that the passenger jet was diverted from its original destination in Grozny, Chechnya because of Ukrainian drones in the area, as well as fog. \n\nWhile flight J2-8243 was trying to land in the southern Russian republic, \u201cUkrainian combat drones were carrying out terrorist attacks on civilian infrastructure in the cities of Grozny and Vladikavkaz,\u201d Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia\u2019s Federal Air Transport Agency, said. \n\nBecause of this, Yadrov said, the area\u2019s skies were closed, which meant that aircraft in the vicinity needed to leave the airspace immediately. \n\nThe plane\u2019s pilot attempted to land in Grozny twice, Yadrov said, but was unsuccessful. He was offered other airports to land in, the official continued, but the pilot \u201cdecided to proceed to the Aktau airport\u201d across the Caspian Sea in Kazakhstan. There was also dense fog in the area of \u200b\u200bthe Grozny airport, he said. \n\nIn a statement on Friday, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said Russian media has \u201clied about the cause of the crash,\u201d adding that Moscow \u201cforced the damaged jet to cross the sea, most likely in an attempt to conceal evidence of their crime.\u201d \n\n\u201cPhotos and videos from the cabin and after the crash are a smoking gun,\u201d Sybiha said, calling for a \u201cfair and impartial investigation to ensure that those responsible are held to account.\u201d \n\nAndriy Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine\u2019s Center for Countering Disinformation, part of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, previously claimed that the plane was \u201cshot down by a Russian air defense system.\u201d \n\nVideo and images of the plane after it crashed show perforations in its body that look similar to damage from shrapnel or debris.

I also tried to help,\u201d Ragimli said, \u201cI sat on the left side, I helped, I was providing first aid. At that moment, we heard a sound, panic began.\u201d \n\nPassenger Vafa Shabanova told Reuters about explosions she heard. \u201cAbout 20 or 30 minutes after takeoff, we felt two explosions. The plane was supposed to land, but it didn\u2019t. Something exploded inside twice. A man\u2019s hand was injured. We panicked,\u201d Shabanova said. \n\nRakhimov, a passenger interviewed by Reuters, described being thrown up and down inside the plane, despite his seatbelt being fastened. \u201cSuddenly everything became quiet,\u201d he said, and he realized that the plane had landed. \n\nHe tried to help a women out of the fuselage, but couldn\u2019t move her as her legs were trapped, he said.

No, you aren\u2019t. \n\nWe are firmly charging into a new era of travel, led by innovations and explorations that seemed impossible or, at best, highly unlikely only a few years ago. New planes, new routes, new partnerships and new strategies are the name of the game for the year ahead \u2026 not to mention that you\u2019ll definitely be hearing more about Greenland than perhaps ever before. \n\nNow, nearly five years out from the devastation that Covid wreaked on the airline industry, optimism has returned. With it comes full flights, yes, but 2025 is a steamroller of shifts that will further open up the world to travelers at the same time as charging them more for the privilege. \n\nThese are the trends in air travel you need to know about for the year ahead. \n\n##  Brand-new routes connect the US and Europe like never before \n\nDelta is expanding its routes to include 33 new European destinations, including Sicily.\n\nleonori/iStock Editorial/Getty Images\n\nIn September, Delta Air Lines proclaimed that 2025 would see a record summer for the airline, with the At peak, the airline will operate 700 weekly flights across the ocean, to 33 European destinations. \n\nA few of these new routes include Atlanta to Brussels and Naples, Italy; Boston to Barcelona and Milan; Minneapolis to Copenhagen and Rome; New York-JFK to Catania, Sicily; and Detroit to Dublin. \n\n\u201cMore than one million people with Irish heritage call Michigan home,\u201d said Wayne County Airport Authority CEO Chad Newton in the announcement. \u201cWe expect this first-ever DTW to Dublin route will be in high-demand.\u201d \n\nAdditionally, Delta\u2019s nonstop route between Tampa and Amsterdam, which was originally a seasonal offering scheduled to end in late spring 2025 will now operate year-round. \n\nNot to be outdone, in October , also promising its largest-ever transatlantic schedule, with new flights to Spain, Italy, France, Greece and Croatia. \n\nOnce these routes commence from May 2025, United\u2019s service across the Atlantic will number 760 weekly flights to over 40 destinations. \n\nCompletely new routes include Newark to Nuuk, Greenland; Palermo, Italy; Bilbao, Spain; Madeira Island, Portugal; and Faro, Portugal. \n\nThe airline is also adding three new nonstop routes from Dulles International in Washington D.C., to Dakar, Senegal; Nice, France; and Venice, Italy. The number of weekly direct flights between Newark and Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Dubrovnik, Croatia; and Athens, Greece will also increase. \n\nRounding out the big three US carriers with route announcements is American Airlines, with 70 . \n\n[ JUAN MABROMATA/AFP/Getty Images Related article 10 oldest airlines in the world ](/travel/article/worlds-oldest-airlines)\n\nNew routes include between Charlotte and Athens, Greece; Chicago and Madrid; Miami and Rome; and Philadelphia to both Edinburgh, Scotland, and Italy\u2019s Milan-Malpensa Airport. \n\nAmerican will also bring back 2024\u2019s seasonal Europe flights to Copenhagen, Naples and Nice, France, for summer 2025. \n\nJetBlue Airways is another that\u2019s in 2025 with the May 22 introduction of flights between Boston and both Edinburgh and Madrid. \n\nOn the international scene, United Arab Emirates-based, including between Abu Dhabi and Atlanta, flying four times weekly beginning July 2, 2025. \n\nFor West Coasters hoping for a bite of the new route news, the will begin flying between Amsterdam and San Diego, operating three times weekly from May 8, 2025. \n\n##  Higher fees and new paperwork have travelers looking away from London \n\nFlying to Britain is getting more expensive.\n\nAlexandre Rotenberg/Shutterstock\n\nMore options across the Atlantic couldn\u2019t be arriving at a better time, easing London\u2019s air travel chokehold on transatlantic connections at the same time as it gets more expensive than ever to fly via Britain. \n\nThe UK\u2019s Air Passenger Duty (APD) was introduced in 1994 to improve national revenue, and it typically rises yearly with inflation. Rolled into the overall ticket price, it\u2019s levied per passenger and based on both the flight length and the passenger\u2019s cabin class. \n\nFor 2025, the UK government is planning an even larger adjustment to offset higher-than-normal inflation. \n\nWhile economy travelers won\u2019t see much of a difference \u2014 the APD on one economy class ticket from London to New York, for example, is \u00a388 ($112) in 2024, only \u00a31 more than 2023\u2019s rate \u2014 flyers in classes with 40 inches of legroom or more should brace for a hike in ticket prices. \n\nBeginning April 1, 2025, the APD on a premium seat ticket from London to New York or Los Angeles, for example, will jump by \u00a322, to \u00a3216 ($275). \n\nThe UK is not alone in levying such taxes. France has an eco tax per passenger, although it is far lower, at between 2.63 euros and 63.07 euros per passenger (between about $2.75 and $65). In 2025, Denmark will also launch one of its own; the begins on January 1, 2025, charging between 30 DKK ($4) and 300 DKK ($42) to passengers on all commercial flights from Denmark (except to Greenland and the Faroe Islands). \n\n[ An aerial view of a Maldivian beach. Levente Bodo/Moment RF/Getty Images Related article It\u2019s expensive to visit the Maldives. Now it\u2019s more expensive to leave, too ](/2024/11/26/travel/maldives-departure-tax-increase-intl-hnk)\n\nThe fees for UK travel don\u2019t end with the APD, either. Starting January 8, will be necessary for some foreign visitors who aren\u2019t required to have a visa. This includes travelers from the United States. Visitors from Europe will pay from April 2. \n\nTravelers must apply for an ETA and pay the associated \u00a310 (about $13) fee before flying to the UK. The good news is that once a traveler has it, the ETA will apply for all of their UK travel for a period of two years. \n\nSimply transiting through a UK airport won\u2019t even save you from the ETA fee. Layover passengers, including those who stay \u201cairside\u201d at the airport between flights, will also need to secure an ETA ahead of their travel. \n\nThe fees keep on coming; seven of the UK airports that charge \u201cdrop-off\u201d fees for private vehicles bringing passengers to the airport raised these by between 50p to \u00a31 (about $1.25) in the last year, with future hikes expected in 2026. One of the most expensive, London\u2019s Gatwick International Airport, now costs a vehicle \u00a36 (about $7.50) for a stay of 10 minutes or less. Surprisingly, only three UK airports \u2014 London City, Inverness and Cardiff \u2014 still allow for free drop-offs. \n\nUK airports aren\u2019t alone in their fee hikes. On December 1, 2024, the Indian Ocean archipelago of the Maldives [raised departure fees](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/26/travel/maldives-departure-tax-increase-intl-hnk/index.html) for all non-Maldivian visitors. This departure tax, also typically rolled into the price of a ticket, is per passenger and based on the class of service. \n\nPassengers in economy class leaving the Maldives will pay $50 (up from $30); business class $120 (from $60); first class $240 (from $90); and private jet travelers $480 per person (up from $120). \n\nAnd to help fund over $2 billion in airport improvements, fees for departing Singapore\u2019s Changi International Airport will steadily increase over the next five years, from $46 SGD (about $35) to $66 SGD (about $49) per passenger. Tack onto that the potential of higher airfares to Singapore overall, as airlines pass on the additional cost of landing and operational costs at Changi, set to rise from April 2025. \n\n##  Greenland emerges as the destination du jour \n\nNuuk International Airport will see new direct United Airlines flights to Newark in the year ahead.\n\nVisit Nuuk\n\nWith a modern terminal building and freshly opened 6,560-foot-long runway suitable for larger aircraft arriving from North America and Europe, Nuuk International Airport will be a destination newly added to a few airline route maps in 2025. Prior to the new runway, most international flights to Greenland have arrived in Kangerlussuaq, with passengers taking connecting flights to Nuuk. \n\nOn June 14, 2025, Nuuk will celebrate the arrival of the first non-stop route from the US, scheduled twice weekly from Newark on United Airlines. \n\nThe Danish territory\u2019s own airline, Air Greenland, will naturally also seize the opportunity, increasing the frequency of already operating routes, as well as welcoming new flights to both Aalborg and Billund in Denmark. \n\n[ Visit Nuuk Related article Traveling to Greenland is about to get easier as new international airport opens ](/2024/11/27/travel/greenland-nuuk-international-airport-new)\n\nScandinavian Airlines (SAS) is also set to begin flights between Nuuk and Copenhagen, and Icelandair will fly three times a week over summer 2025 between Keflavik and Nuuk. \n\nTwo additional airports, in Ilulissat in the west of the territory and Qaqortoq, farther south, both known for their scenic fjords and imposing icebergs, are expected to be operational by the end of 2026. \n\n##  More creative long-haul routes arrive with a new airplane \n\nThe A321XLR promises to be a game-changer for passenger aviation.\n\nAirbus\n\nNew airplanes are always exciting, and 2025 will welcome a fresh bird to more skies, which brings with it increased opportunity to fly even more diverse routes, connecting cities that may have never been connected before. \n\nLaunched in 2019 at the Paris Air Show, Airbus\u2019 A321XLR (\u201cExtra Long Range\u201d) is an update of the A321neo, with more fuel capacity, increased efficiency, and other incremental improvements towards longer-haul flying.

In January 2025, more A321XLR deliveries to the Spanish airline will allow them also to begin a route between Madrid and Washington D.C.\u2019s Dulles International Airport. \n\nAround 25 airlines have the A321XLR on order, including JetBlue, Delta, United, American, Air Canada and Aer Lingus, with the Irish airline hoping to use it to begin nonstop flights between Dublin and Nashville from April 2025. \n\n##  Shake-ups in airline alliances shift major players \n\nITA Airways is joining the Star Alliance group of airlines.\n\nIsabel Infantes/Reuters\n\nShifts in alliances and partnership in the air travel industry happen regularly, but 2025 will be a year of watching some more shocking ones play out as flyers learn how their travel plans and loyalties may be affected. \n\nScandinavian Airlines (SAS), an original founding member of Star Alliance, departed the alliance on August 31, 2024, , following Air France-KLM Group\u2019s acquisition of 19.9% of the airline. With SAS, SkyTeam can now claim the distinction of serving the southernmost (Ushuaia, Argentina) and northernmost (Svalbard, Norway) commercial airports in the world. \n\nThe year ahead will see the airline\u2019s flyers and those of other SkyTeam member airlines coming to understand how this new member\u2019s network enhances their travels and opens up more possibilities for points redemption, such as redeeming Air France-KLM FlyingBlue miles for seats on SAS routes. \n\nRevenge is coming in 2025, however; ITA Airways, the airline that took over Alitalia, has announced that it will depart SkyTeam for Star Alliance. Although no exact date has yet been set, the shift follows Lufthansa\u2019s 49% investment in ITA. With the German airline being a founding member of the Star Alliance, it will want to welcome ITA into the fold sooner rather than later. \n\n[ Frontier Airlines plane seen at Cancun International Airport.

Both historic, beloved brands will continue to exist and operate, a first for an US airline acquisition. They are expected to combine loyalty programs in 2025, however. \n\nFinally, Southwest Airlines, a free agent in the world of alliances, has inked a new partnership with Icelandair set to begin in 2025. This link-up will allow travelers to easily connect between the two airlines\u2019 networks. \n\nIt remains to be seen how this partnership will (or will not) stretch to frequent flyer miles earning and award redemptions, but the possibility of spending Southwest Rapid Rewards to reach distant destinations like Istanbul (a new I, beginning September 5, 2025), or flying non-stop from (a new Icelandair route, beginning May 16, 2025) is closer than ever. \n\n##  Flying becomes the worst way to earn frequent flyer status \n\nLooking to increase your air miles? The best way might be to drive your car.\n\nValerie Plesch/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWhen American Airlines changed its AAdvantage loyalty program model in 2022, the focus shifted away from earning frequent flyer status through, well, frequently flying, towards earning \u201cLoyalty Points\u201d through a combination of flying and spending money across an entire field of American\u2019s partners. \n\nIncredibly, one can now reach top status without flying even a single mile on an American Airlines plane. \n\n\u201cMost frequent flyers loyal to the airline were only familiar with the traditional approach of earning status through butt-in-seat flying,\u201d explains Norbert Krupa, the Chicago-based founder who launched the Loyalty Point Hunters website and online community to demystify the new system. \n\n\u201cIf someone is starting from scratch, they need $6,000 of spending through flying to achieve American\u2019s [lowest] Gold status. Or they could earn Gold by spending about $600 through new avenues and methods with the help of Loyalty Point Hunters.\u201d \n\n\u201cMost travelers travel once or twice a year and are unlikely to pay attention or come to the realization that status can be easily available to them.\u201d \n\n[ CHICAGO, IL - MAY 11: An American Airlines aricraft sits at a gate at O'Hare International Airport on May 11, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois.

At the end of November FlyingBlue, the loyalty program of Air France and KLM, announced \u201cSubscribe to Miles,\u201d a program that offers exactly what it sounds like. \n\nFor a set payment each month, the scheme will deposit frequent flyer miles into a traveler\u2019s account, no flying necessary. Plans start from 28 euros ($29.39) for 2,000 miles monthly, and reach 187 euros for 17,000 miles monthly. \n\nConsidering how it would take a flyer many international economy roundtrips to earn that many miles, and that a one-way from New York to Paris can be found for 15,000 points in economy class, it\u2019s a deal that may meet with quick success. \n\nFrequent flyer programs have become a crucial part of the airline industry\u2019s profitability, and there\u2019s no end in sight for the billions of dollars and trillions or quadrillions, potentially quintillions-plus of points that drive it all forward. \n\n##  Upgrades will be even more rare (and less complimentary) \n\nHoping for an upgrade? Chances are you'll stay stuck with everyone else in the cheap seats.\n\nJessica McGowan/Getty Images\n\nAirline status isn\u2019t the only thing getting harder to attain and maintain. Upgrades to premium seats, one of the biggest motivations for aiming for status in the first place, are increasingly rare. \n\nWhile corporate travel numbers are trending up and the glut of consumers reaching status by means other than flying does bloat the ranks of frequent flyer tiers and create more competition for what few seats may be available for upgrading on a flight, the greater cause lies with the airlines themselves. \n\nThey\u2019re simply getting better about selling all of the seats in those premium cabins. \n\n\u200b\u200bDuring Delta Air Lines\u2019 November 2024 Investor Day, the airline\u2019s president Glen Hauenstein noted that, 15 years ago, only 12% of the seats in the domestic first class cabin were purchased, with the rest given to upgraded members with Medallion status. Today it has flipped, and 12% is now the number of first class seats given to upgrades. What changed? \n\n\u201cWe were charging 13 times more than the average coach seat at the time of booking,\u201d stated Hauenstein. \u201cSo we brought that separation way down, we\u2019ve made them much more affordable. And guess what? When you make something affordable, people want to buy it.\u201d \n\nMore affordable premium seats is also part of American Airlines\u2019 current strategy, as the airline rolled out paid upgrade offers to those already holding economy class tickets. \n\nNow you may go into the AA app to check your booking, and find an offer to upgrade to a confirmed first-class seat on a flight from Chicago to Dallas. On such a popular route between two hubs, with countless elite frequent flyers also vying for an upgrade, a lower tier flyer might not have stood a chance on the upgrade list. But now, for a dynamic sum that changes with demand and, sometimes, by the minute, you can secure that premium seat (and earn points for the price paid to upgrade). \n\n[ Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, from Qatar Aieways company, landing at Barcelona airport, in Barcelona on 04th January 2023. -- (Photo by Urbanandsport/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Urbanandsport/NurPhoto/Getty Images Related article World\u2019s best airline for 2024 named by Skytrax ](/2024/06/24/travel/worlds-best-airline-2024-skytrax)\n\nOn the international scene, airlines continue the trend of shrinking or even eliminating first class in favor of expanding and improving business class cabins. That may be a boon to travelers hoping to upgrade from economy, but for those already in business class eager to taste the caviar service of hallowed international first class, the opportunity is rapidly dwindling. \n\nOman Air discontinued its first class cabin in September 2024, rebranding the private suites instead as \u201cBusiness Studio\u201d seats and selling them at a premium above business class, but below previous first-class ticket prices. \n\nAmerican Airlines is eliminating first class on its Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, increasing the number of business and premium seats by more than 45% by 2026. It\u2019ll also phase out first class on the previously three-class A321Ts that fly cross-country premium routes in the United States. For its A321XLRs yet to be delivered, first class has been replaced by a beefed-up business class, complete with privacy doors. \n\n##  Lost luggage becomes a thing of the past \n\nAirTag bag tracking is going mainstream.\n\nAaron Schwartz/AFP/Middle East Images/Getty Images\n\nFinally, a trend that only just barely began in 2024 is set to go mainstream in 2025, and that\u2019s the growing partnership between airlines and Apple over the use of AirTags for locating lost luggage. \n\nIn early December 2024, with the release of iOS 18.2 for models iPhone X and newer, Apple introduced \u201cShare Item Location,\u201d a new feature to help users locate and recover misplaced items by easily sharing a secure link to the location of an AirTag (or \u201cFind My\u201d network accessory \u2014 that means AirPods, Macbooks and more Apple products) with third parties, such as airlines. \n\n[ Luggage in the baggage claim area of at Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, on December 28, 2022.

But Nintendo thankfully didn\u2019t get a case of senioritis as it looks to graduate to a Switch sequel, as 2024 had a litany of excellent titles come to the nearly eight-year-old console. So we\u2019re taking a little look back at some of our favorite games on the Switch for 2024. One of the great things about this year\u2019s offering of Switch titles is that they all should work on the follow-up to the Switch \u2014 [since Nintendo confirmed its next generation will be backward-compatible](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation). (And hopefully any performance issues of games on the current Switch will be resolved when playing them on the next model, if we\u2019re so lucky.)\n\nWe all have to remain patient as we continue to wait for the Switch\u2019s successor, but these games are without a doubt worthy of playing during your current Nintendo console\u2019s final months in the limelight.\n\n[Read Article >](/24317154/nintendo-switch-best-games-2024-top-10-goty)\n\n  * Dec 27\n\n[Andrew Webster](/authors/andrew-webster)\n\n## [9 great Game Pass games for your Xbox](/24317923/xbox-game-pass-best-games-2024-microsoft-pc)\n\nImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images\n\nEven if it wasn\u2019t the strongest year for Xbox exclusive games ([and some of those exclusives had their issues](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301358/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-launch-day-issues)), Game Pass was still an extremely good deal for console owners. Mostly, it\u2019s the variety; the subscription service continues to offer a great mix of new blockbuster releases, along with smaller indie games and older titles to round out the package. This year had everything from _Call of Duty_ \u2019s big coming-out party on Game Pass to a stop-motion adventure game to an expansion to one of last year\u2019s biggest RPGs.\n\nHere are nine great games to check out if you\u2019re a new subscriber or just looking for something new to play.\n\n[Read Article >](/24317923/xbox-game-pass-best-games-2024-microsoft-pc)\n\n  * Dec 27\n\n[Ash Parrish](/authors/ash-parrish)\n\n## [2024\u2019s best games channeled the heart and soul of the \u201890s](/24325371/2024s-best-games-classic-genres-astro-bot-balatro-metaphor)\n\nImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge\n\nIn 2024, we gamed like it was 1997.

What makes _Metaphor_ \u2019s combat interesting in a way that\u2019s hard to replicate with traditional turn-based RPGs is that Atlus has built a unique ability system powered by anticipation and anxiety. Characters have access to powerful summons, each with their own abilities, along with strengths and weaknesses that enemies also share.

Roguelike games can be famously tough to crack into; generally, they have a high difficulty that means you\u2019ll bang your head against a wall as you learn how to play the game, puzzle out what strategies work best in the procedurally generated levels, and figure out how to overcome tough enemies or challenges. 2024 showed that the genre wasn\u2019t only a commercial force through hits like _Hades II_ and _Balatro_ , and also that a roguelike could be almost anything: from a poker variant to a flashy multiplayer action game.\n\nSpeaking of [_Balatro_](https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame), it was undoubtedly one of, if not _the_ , best games of the year. The game is supremely easy to pick up because of its roots in building traditional poker hands, but each round feels wildly different because of the clever and sometimes superpowered joker cards that can give you massive bonuses. The game is a perfect mix of skill, risk, and a little bit of luck, and it feels so good when you find a strategy that completely stacks the chips in your favor.

However, one category bucked this trend: smart door locks.\n\nThe past 12 months have been a stellar period for smart front door hardware, and 2025 looks set to be even better.

But 2024 was a relatively quiet year for smartwatches, during which iterative updates reigned supreme. That happens in a maturing category. In exchange for polished products, you lose out on the weird frenetic energy \u2014 and sometimes ludicrously bad ideas \u2014 found when people are trying to figure out how to make a nascent gadget category work. Thankfully, it seems that energy is starting to bubble up with smart rings.\n\nSmart rings are not new, but in 2024, there was a sort of renaissance for the category. I had an inkling that might be the case back in January, when several smart rings [littered the CES show floor](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24034978/smart-ring-oura-ring-evie-ring-zepp-helio-ces-2024).

Samsung is a major player in the smartwatch space. For them to branch out into an entirely new wearable category? That\u2019s _big_.

Twitter was never the biggest or most successful social network \u2014 far from it \u2014 but Twitter was at the absolute epicenter of culture for years. It was where politicians went to talk to their constituents and emergency services went to tell people what was happening. It was where newsmakers dropped their scoops first. It was, by a mile, the place you were most likely to have your message actually read \u2014 or even replied to! \u2014 by an A-list celebrity or your favorite brand.

Older models are unaffected. You can tell if you have a unit with the blood oxygen feature disabled if the part number ends in LW/A._\n\nIt used to be easy to pick an Apple Watch. All you had to do was choose whether you wanted the larger model or the smaller one. Then Apple added optional cellular connectivity. Then, a more affordable [Watch SE](https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features) (now in its [second generation](https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch)) and, in 2022, the rugged [Apple Watch Ultra](https://www.theverge.com/23363948/apple-watch-ultra-review-rugged-smartwatch-gps) (also now in its [second generation](https://www.theverge.com/23363948/apple-watch-ultra-review-rugged-smartwatch-gps)). Suddenly, there are _lots_ of options. \n\nNow that Apple has [released the Series 10](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24236801/apple-watch-series-10-price-specs-features-release-date),perfectly good older versions of the Apple Watch are getting discounted as retailers try to empty their inventory. You may also see more refurbished versions of these older models pop up. If you\u2019re interested in more premium materials, like stainless steel, this is a great way to get a fancier version of last year\u2019s watch. You won\u2019t be missing out on too much, either. The past few years have seen iterative updates in terms of hardware \u2014 and the bulk of new features come from software updates.With that said, keep in mind that the latest version of watchOS, [watchOS 11](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24170653/apple-watch-watchos-11-features-updates-wwdc), doesn\u2019t support the Series 4, 5, and first-gen SE.\n\n### Related\n\n  * [watchOS 11 puts a Dynamic Island on your wrist](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253366/watch-os-11-apple-watch-smartwatch)\n  * [The best smartwatches for Android](https://www.theverge.com/23449363/best-android-smartwatches-wear-os)\n  * [The best MagSafe and Qi2 chargers for your iPhone](https://www.theverge.com/23505846/best-magsafe-magnetic-chargers-apple-iphone)\n\n\n\nBuying refurbished is one way that you may be able to upgrade from an older model without giving up blood oxygen. Due to a patent battle with Masimo, new Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the US after January 18th, 2024, [no longer have this feature](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24042395/apple-watch-ultra-2-series-9-ban-blood-oxygen-stores). This is not a big deal for most people, but if that feature is important to you, older watches and Series 9 and Ultra 2 units sold by Apple before January 18th still had the feature. (As do watches overseas. The ban only impacts US units.) \n\nWhat about the new Series 10? In a nutshell, it\u2019s got a bigger screen, it\u2019s about 10 percent thinner, and it\u2019s lighter than previous models. It\u2019s also got a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature. There are a ton of new colors and finishes, with titanium replacing stainless steel. All in all, it\u2019s an iterative update but one we find meaningful in terms of readability and wearability.\n\nSo much choice can lead to analysis paralysis. But don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve tested every single version of the Apple Watch you can buy right now \u2014 in addition to [basically every other fitness watch and smartwatch on the market](https://www.theverge.com/smartwatch-review) \u2014 and can steer you in the right direction. \n\n## How to choose an Apple Watch\n\n[Should you get an Apple Watch?]()\n\n[Apple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?]()\n\n[The best Apple Watch if you\u2019re on a budget]()\n\n[The best Apple Watch for kids]()\n\n[The best Apple Watch for older relatives]()\n\n### Should you get an Apple Watch?\n\n_The Apple Watch Ultra was introduced in 2022 as the new rugged kid on the block._\n\nThe Apple Watch is the best overall smartwatch for iPhone users. Many smartwatches are better than the Apple Watch for hardcore athletes, even with the Ultra models in the mix. But other watches fall short when it comes to productivity, safety features, controlling your smart home, and interacting with other Apple devices and services. And the Apple Watch has the most robust third-party app ecosystem of any smartwatch on the market. \n\nBy their nature, wearables are incredibly personal devices \u2014 and you won\u2019t get the benefits of an Apple Watch if you don\u2019t wear it regularly. The last thing you want is to spend hundreds of dollars on a thing that ends up collecting dust in a drawer. The best way to avoid this is to stack the deck in your favor and prioritize comfort. Before you try to start mulling over which Apple Watch model you should get, take a second to figure out which size and strap material will best fit your wrist. \n\n### What we\u2019re looking for[Return to table of contents\u21b4]()\n\n#### **Who is it for?**\n\nWe\u2019re not going to recommend an Apple Watch Ultra for a couch potato \u2014 unless you want the best battery life possible. The idea is to guide you to the right Apple Watch for your needs.\n\n#### **Price**\n\nShould you buy new? You can often save on an Apple Watch by buying refurbished, especially since there generally aren\u2019t a ton of changes year to year.\n\n#### **Feature set**\n\nDo you want to shell out extra for LTE? Which models have what sensors, and how does that apply to you?\n\n#### **LTE or GPS**\n\nSome scenarios call for you to buy cellular models, others you can get away with just having GPS. \n\nThe SE and Series watches come in two sizes each. The SE comes in 40mm and 44mm, while the Series 7, 8, and 9 are 41mm and 45mm. The new Series 10 ups the size again to 42mm and 46mm. The larger models are better for readability, while the smaller ones are more comfortable for those with petite wrists. Both the SE and the Series watches have aluminum cases, but the Series 10 now comes in titanium, too. (Older models come in stainless steel.) Most people will be fine with aluminum, but if you\u2019re clumsy or very active, you\u2019ll benefit from the extra durability offered by stainless steel or titanium. You might also just like the look better \u2014 and that\u2019s valid since watches are a personal piece of tech. Just be prepared to pay a few hundred bucks more for that. \n\n_Polished titanium replaces stainless steel with the new Series 10. It\u2019s quite fetching._\n\nAs for straps, we recommend the , as it\u2019s the most breathable option, has the easiest clasp, and is less irritating than the silicone options, which is great for sensitive skin. If you want more fashionable options, we recommend checking out Amazon or Etsy for a wider variety of styles and more affordable pricing. \n\nYou\u2019ll want to check third parties for leather accessories, too. With the Series 9, Apple announced it will no longer make leather accessories in a bid to achieve carbon neutrality. Apple does have a suede-like FineWoven alternative, but it\u2019s expensive, and in my experience, the material is extremely polarizing. Most _Verge_ staffers agree it works better on the watch than on the phone case, but save yourself some grief and feel it out for yourself at an Apple Store before buying.\n\nThe Ultra and Ultra 2 both come in one size \u2014 49mm \u2014 and with titanium cases. They come with their own special straps, too: the trail loop, alpine loop, and ocean loop. As their names suggest, they\u2019re geared toward runners, hikers, and divers, but you can pick whichever one suits your fancy. We recommend the Trail Loop, as it\u2019s the lightest and most versatile of the three. All the Ultra straps work with any 44mm or 45mm Serieswatch, and the Ultra is compatible with any 44mm or 45mm Apple Watch strap. \n\nAnd while the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch you can get as an iPhone user, you can also always check out our [fitness tracker buying guide](https://www.theverge.com/22985108/best-fitness-tracker). \n\n### Apple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?\n\n$349$39913% off\n\n$349\n\n$349$39913% off\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 has a larger, wide-angle OLED display with up to 30 percent more screen area. It\u2019s also thinner and lighter than its predecessors.\n\nThis year\u2019s Series 10 is a more modest update. It primarily focuses on making the watches more comfortable while adding a larger, wide-angle OLED display. If you\u2019re upgrading from an older model, you\u2019ll definitely notice that you can see more from the wrist. The speakers now play music and podcasts, and voice isolation on calls has been improved. There\u2019s an added depth and water temperature sensor, which makes it a better companion for water sports as well. Fast charging has also been meaningfully improved. On the health front, Apple has brought FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection to the watch, along with the Series 9 and Ultra 2. \n\nWe recommend the second-genApple Watch SE for younger people and first-time smartwatch buyers. If you\u2019re upgrading from an earlier Apple Watch, you want an always-on display, or you want more advanced health tracking, you should consider the Series 10. And if you want the brightest screen, the best durability and battery life, and even more advanced fitness features, we recommend the Ultra 2.\n\n_The Series 10 focuses on making the watch more readable and comfortable to wear._\n\nThe Series 10 is Apple\u2019s flagship smartwatch. Compared to earlier models, it\u2019s going to get you the fastest processor, quick charging, a larger display, and all the latest sensors. Prices start at $399 for the 42mm version and $429 for the 46mm. Adding LTE connectivity will add $100 to the price, plus whatever your carrier charges for the service. Prices start at $699 for the polished titanium models.\n\n### Related\n\n  * [Apple Watch Series 10: an Ultra sleek package](https://www.theverge.com/24246464/apple-watch-series-10-review-smartwatch-wearables)\n  * [Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 review: small but smart improvements](https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri)\n  * [The Apple Watch SE is a first-time buyer\u2019s smartwatch](https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch)\n\n\n\nThe second-gen SE has a nylon composite back, which helps shave $30 off the original\u2019s price. You can get a cellular version, and it supports many of the same advanced features as the last-gen Series 8, like fall detection, emergency calling, Fitness Plus, Apple Pay, and [Family Setup](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876324/apple-watch-series-8-body-temperature-smartwatch). The biggest difference is that it lacks an always-on display, the EKG sensor, the temperature sensors, and the SpO2 sensor. The display is also slightly smaller on both sizes of the SE. It starts at $249 for the 40mm and $279 for the 44mm. Adding LTE will tack on an extra $50 in addition to your carrier\u2019s fees. \n\n$189$24924% off\n\n$189\n\n$189$24924% off\n\nThe latest SE borrows a few features from the Series 8, including the same chipset and Crash Detection feature, but it\u2019s an otherwise subtle upgrade from the last-gen SE.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, if you\u2019re young and healthy, you\u2019re not really missing out on EKG or SpO2. (Also, new watches sold in the US currently have the SpO2 feature disabled anyway.) The SE\u2019s heart rate sensor is still capable of providing abnormal heart rate alerts. Right now, Apple\u2019s SpO2 features are limited to spot checks. There\u2019s not much you can do with that information, and unlike the EKGs, this is only cleared for general wellness purposes. It will _not_ be able to replace a fingertip pulse oximeter, and you should never use it in this way.\n\nThe main purpose of the EKG sensor is to enable atrial fibrillation detection \u2014 and if your doctor\u2019s given you a clean bill of health, you will likely only use this feature once or twice. According to the American Heart Association, the are advanced age, underlying heart conditions, high blood pressure, family history, and sleep apnea, among other lifestyle choices. If this doesn\u2019t apply to you, the SE is still going to give you an excellent health tracking experience and all the same smart features. Young, first-time buyers may as well save the extra $150 \u2014 so long as the lack of an always-on display isn\u2019t a deal-breaker. \n\n _You can\u2019t really see much of a difference between the Ultra on the left and the Ultra 2 on the right._\n\nThere are some situations where opting for the Series 10 is the better choice, however, like if you want an always-on display or need to have the latest and greatest. The larger, wide-angle OLED display also provides much better readability for anyone with bad eyesight. It\u2019s also the better choice if you have a heart condition or are at a higher risk of developing AFib. If you suspect you may have sleep apnea, you\u2019ll also need a Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 to access that feature.\n\n$720$79910% off\n\n$720\n\n$720$79910% off\n\nThe rugged Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes in one size: 49mm. It offers the brightest display of any wearable in Apple\u2019s lineup, along with better battery life and improved performance. It sports Apple\u2019s last-gen S9 SiP, too, allowing you to take advantage of Apple\u2019s handy double tap feature.\n\nThe [Ultra 2](https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri) currently sits atop the lineup as Apple\u2019s premium smartwatch. It\u2019s visually distinct from both the Series and SE \u2014 and at 49mm, it\u2019s the biggest of them all. Not only that, it has increased durability, water resistance, and a raised lip to protect the flat display. It also has an additional water temperature and depth sensor for divers, three microphones, and two speakers, which enable the Siren. It\u2019s also got the Action button, which [can be programmed](https://www.theverge.com/23365635/apple-watch-ultra-action-button-how-to) for various activities, pause workouts, and trigger the Siren.\n\n### Related\n\n  * [The next Apple Watch Ultra could have satellite texting](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24318154/apple-watch-ultra-satellite-texting-messaging-blood-pressure-monitoring)\n  * [The best deals on Apple Watches right now](https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals)\n\n\n\nAt $799, the Ultra 2 is the most expensive Apple Watch, but every model comes equipped with LTE capability. If you have an Ultra and are wondering if you should upgrade to the second-gen model, the answer is no. If you have an Ultra 2 and are wondering if you should upgrade to the new black color, the answer is also no. (Admittedly, it does look quite nice.) It\u2019s too soon, and there\u2019s not enough of a difference. We recommend the Ultra 2 for new buyers only. \n\n### What about blood oxygen?[Return to table of contents\u21b4]()\n\nAs of January 18th, Apple no longer sells new Apple Watch Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 models with the blood oxygen feature in the US. That\u2019s because Apple is currently undergoing [a patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo](https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/28/24016913/apple-patent-dispute-masimo-lagemo-true-wearables). The International Trade Commission has ruled that Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature infringe on two of Masimo\u2019s patents \u2014 and are therefore [subject to an import ban](https://www.theverge.com/24009254/apple-watch-itc-ban-patent-dispute). \n\nThis doesn\u2019t affect watches sold outside of the US, or the Apple Watch SE, which doesn\u2019t have the blood oxygen sensor in question. Watches sold by third-party retailers like Best Buy or Amazon may be unaffected if they\u2019re selling refurbished models or happen to have pre-ban Series 9 or Ultra 2 inventory. You can tell if a model doesn\u2019t have the blood oxygen feature if the part numbers end in LW/A. It also does not affect the new sleep apnea detection feature, which utilizes the accelerometer.\n\nThat said, the blood oxygen feature is not that vital a feature on _any_ wearable just yet. Many either have spot check features only or passively track your SpO2 overnight and give you an average in the morning. They [cannot](https://www.theverge.com/21438576/blood-oxygen-apple-watch-series-6-reliability) [and should not](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21504023/apple-watch-ekg-blood-oxygen-fda-clearance) replace fingertip pulse oximeters. But if the feature is important to you, you may want to look into alternatives from [Garmin](https://www.theverge.com/23691498/best-garmin-smartwatch-fitness-tracker-wearables), the [Fitbit Charge 6](https://www.theverge.com/23958997/fitbit-charge-6-review-fitness-tracker-side-button), the Withings ScanWatch 2, or the [Oura Ring](https://www.theverge.com/22789248/oura-ring-3-review-sleep-tracker-fitness-tracker). \n\nIf battery life is your highest priority, getting either Ultra is the best choice. In testing, we got up to 60 hours without Low Power Mode enabled. However, if you use about one hour of GPS tracking a day or take calls, you\u2019re more likely to get around two days. It\u2019s also the better choice if you frequently hike, dive, or run trails. While marketed as a hardcore watch for explorers, in our opinion, it\u2019s more of an aspirational watch for weekend warriors and intermediate athletes \u2014 or anyone who _wants_ to be at that level.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to beat either Ultra on battery life, but you can stretch out the battery life on the Series 4 or later with Low Power Mode. You can even sleep track with Low Power Mode on, though it\u2019ll turn off background health sensors. With the Series 10, Apple has improved fast charging as well. Official estimates are that you can get 0 to 80 percent in 30 minutes, which roughly matches our real-world testing. Just be sure you\u2019re using the correct charging accessories.\n\nIf you have smaller wrists, you may want to opt for the Series 10 as it has fast charging and is more comfortable to wear long-term. Faster charging comes in clutch when you\u2019re about to head to bed and you\u2019ve only got 15 percent battery. Also, if you\u2019re the type that values futureproofing, the Series 10\u2019s hardware will be able to support newer features for a longer period of time thanks to its newer processor. This is why folks who love their watch and are looking to upgrade from a Series 4 or older should also pick the Series 10. If you\u2019re already in the habit of wearing the watch daily, you\u2019ll get more mileage out of it as the SE is more of a gateway device, and the Ultra is overkill for the average Joe. \n\n### The best Apple Watch if you\u2019re on a budget\n\n$189$24924% off\n\n$189\n\n$189$24924% off\n\nThe latest SE borrows a few features from the Series 8, including the same chipset and Crash Detection feature, but it\u2019s an otherwise subtle upgrade from the last-gen SE.\n\nThe latest [Watch SE](https://www.theverge.com/23353756/apple-watch-series-8-review-smartwatch-wearables) is the way to go for people who want to futureproof their hardware without breaking the bank (so long as you\u2019re okay forgoing a larger display). You\u2019re getting the same processor as the Series 8 and originalUltra, plus Crash Detection. \n\n### Related\n\n  * [The Apple Watch made smartwatches the wearable of choice](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/8/24237890/apple-watch-10-years-smartwatch-wearables)\n  * [The best fitness trackers to buy right now](https://www.theverge.com/22985108/best-fitness-tracker)\n\n\n\nWhile the second-gen SE is an excellent watch, it\u2019s not always the right choice. It\u2019s meant to be a gateway watch, so it\u2019s best suited to folks who are completely new to the Apple Watch and want to spend as little as possible. If you\u2019re looking to upgrade from an older watch but don\u2019t want to pony up for the Series 10, there\u2019s another option: buying a used or refurbished Apple Watch.\n\nBuying secondhand devices is also better for the environment and a more affordable way to get more expensive materials. Materials like sapphire glass, stainless steel, or titanium can add hundreds to the price of a new watch. It\u2019s also a good way to save money if you\u2019re just not excited by the Series 10\u2019s features but want more than what the SE offers.\n\n_Opting for a Series 9 now means you may be able to score stainless steel for a discounted price._\n\n_The second-gen SE is excellent for folks on a budget or those who want a smaller case size._\n\nIt\u2019ll take some patience to find the best price and the model you want. After all, you\u2019re limited by what\u2019s available. However, there are several sites that offer older models. Sometimes, you can also find deals and sales as well. If you\u2019re worried about getting scammed, look for deals recommended by sources you trust (cough, cough, [_Verge Deals_](https://www.theverge.com/good-deals)). Apple also sells , which come with a full Apple warranty and are generally in a \u201clike new\u201d condition, though the selection can be limited, and you likely won\u2019t pay less than a new SE. Sites like will also let you sort by condition and obtain a 12-month warranty. \n\nIf you\u2019re considering a used or refurbished model, we recommend the Series 7 or Series 8 because they\u2019ll get you a larger screen for readability. We also recommend that you use $250 as a benchmark since that\u2019s the price of a new base model Watch SE. With that said, if you\u2019re getting premium materials, going a little higher is fine. Do not get a refurbished Series 3 or older. Although you can find them for $100 (sometimes less!), they can\u2019t run the latest software and [even struggle to update](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience) the newest software they _do_ support. \n\n### The best Apple Watch for kids\n\n$229$29923% off\n\n$229\n\n$229$29923% off\n\nThe latest SE for 2022 borrows a few features from the Series 8, including the same chipset and Crash Detection feature, but it\u2019s an otherwise subtle upgrade from the last-gen SE.\n\nIf you want your child to have an Apple Watch, we recommend picking a cellular Apple Watch SE or, if you can find one, a refurbished Series 4, 5, or 6 with cellular. All of these watches come in smaller sizes than the Series 7, 8, or 9, which will likely better fit their wrist. Also, the lower price will give you better peace of mind if you have a rambunctious kid. They likely won\u2019t need many of the marquee features found in watchOS 11, either. That being said, if you want the most futureproof options, the second-gen SE and Series 6 are the best choices.\n\nSince you\u2019re buying for children, you\u2019ll likely want to use Family Setup, as it will give you greater parental controls. (You can read our review of the feature [here](https://www.theverge.com/21518711/apple-watch-family-setup-test-review-features-explainer).) However, there are technical specifications that you\u2019ll need to match in order to use it. You\u2019ll need a cellular version of the device, and it must at least support watchOS 7. Apple\u2019s states that you need a Series 4 or later or an Apple Watch SE for Family Setup.\n\n_The second-gen SE is a good option to give to your kids._\n\nIf you opt for the Family Setup route, not every feature will be available. While you can get Apple Pay and certain health features, you will not get the following: health data sharing, respiratory rate, irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, Cycle Tracking, Sleep, Blood Oxygen, Podcasts, Remote, News, Home, and Shortcuts.\n\n### The best Apple Watch for older relatives\n\n$490$4992% off\n\n$490\n\n$490$4992% off\n\nThe Series 10\u2019s display is comparable in size to the Ultra 2\u2019s but the watch itself is roughly 30 percent thinner and half the weight.\n\nThis can be a tricky one, but we recommend a cellular Series 9 or 10. \n\nFor starters, the larger screen is much easier on the eyes. You can also increase the text size to be larger than on the SE or older Apple Watches. The always-on display aids accessibility, especially if arm mobility is a consideration. You\u2019ll also get the full suite of health features, including irregular heartbeat alerts, walking steadiness, EKGs, fall detection, sleep apnea detection, and emergency calling. These models also have the double tap feature and improved Siri functionality, which may be helpful for elderly relatives with dexterity issues.\n\nYou can use the Ultra, but you should keep its size and weight in mind. Depending on your loved one\u2019s wrist size and health, it may not make sense. Both sizes of the Series 10 have comparable screen sizes but are much lighter and more comfortable to wear. \n\n _The larger screen size but lighter weight of the Series 10 may benefit older relatives._\n\nIf your older relative has an iPhone and you\u2019re hoping to use this for health reasons, we also don\u2019t recommend Family Setup. That\u2019s because you cannot use features like irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, and health data sharing. If your relative doesn\u2019t have an iPhone, however, Family Setup is a fine option. You\u2019ll still get high and low heart rate notifications, walking steadiness, and fall detection. \n\n _**Update, December 27th** : Updated to reflect current pricing and availability._\n\n## More from [Tech](/tech)\n\n  * ### [The Batman 2 is delayed to 2027, but Mickey 17\u2019s release date is moving up](/2024/12/27/24330346/batman-part-ii-2027-delay-mickey-17-release-date)\n\n  * ### [The best Fitbits for your fitness and health](/22982833/best-fitbit-watch-fitness-tracker)\n\n  * ### [Do Kwon will be extradited to the US to face charges over Terra\u2019s $40 billion crypto crash](/2024/12/27/24330300/terraform-labs-co-founder-do-kwon-extradited-us)\n\n  * ### [The Beats Fit Pro, our favorite fitness-centric earbuds, are matching their best price](/2024/12/27/24330203/beats-fit-pro-epicka-universal-travel-adapter-deal-sale)\n\n\n\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT\n\nUndo\n\nno reason\n\nThank you for your feedback\n\nWe'll try not to show you this content\n\nUndo\n\nno reason\n\nThank you for your feedback\n\nWe'll try not to show you this content\n\nUndo\n\nno reason\n\nThank you for your feedback\n\nWe'll try not to show you this content\n\nUndo\n\nno reason\n\nThank you for your feedback\n\nWe'll try not to show you this content\n\nUndo\n\nno reason\n\nThank you for your feedback\n\nWe'll try not to show you this content\n\nUndo\n\nno reason\n\nThank you for your feedback\n\nWe'll try not to show you this content\n", "date": "2022-04-22T16:25:29Z", "topic": "technology", "bias": 25, "sentiment": "neutral", "summary_and_assessment": "The article presents a thorough and well-researched guide to choosing an Apple Watch, maintaining professional objectivity while providing practical advice.
