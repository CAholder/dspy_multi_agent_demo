I saw him weak. I saw him crying. I saw him saying: \\'This is where I was. I could be one of them. I could be one of them right now, or I could be dead\\'.\\n\\n\"I feel that when he saw this, he felt that this [was] closure,\" she adds. \"Now we want people to hear what Syrians went through.\"\\n\\nAbdullah, 36, was working in Damascus as a store keeper with the International Committee of the Red Cross in July 2013 when he and his colleagues were stopped at a checkpoint on the outskirts of the Syrian capital.\\n\\nHe says he participated in anti-regime protests in 2011 in the southern city of Deraa, where the uprising against Assad began, but soon distanced himself when rebels began to use violence and weapons in response to a brutal crackdown by the regime\\'s forces.\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nA cell in the basement of Al-Khatib \\n\\nAbdullah was singled out at the checkpoint and put on a green bus, handcuffed and blindfolded, and taken to a military area. He says he was then put in solitary confinement for three days and beaten.\\n\\n\"It was so dark for three days, I remember,\" he says. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t [hear] any sound. It was so dark. You hear nothing. You feel so lonely.\"\\n\\nAbdullah was then transported to Al-Khatib, a detention centre in Damascus, and taken to a cell with about 130 people.\\n\\nAl-Khatib was one of several detention facilities operated by Syrian intelligence services. \\n\\nAlmost 60,000 people were tortured and killed in the prisons run by the Assad regime during the civil war, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group.\\n\\nTwo years ago, a historic trial in Germany found [a Syrian colonel who worked in Al-Khatib guilty of crimes against humanity](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-59949924). Anwar Raslan, 58, was linked to the torture of over 4,000 people in the prison.\\n\\nIn court, witnesses described how detainees were [raped and hung from the ceiling](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56160486) for hours, as well as the use of electric shocks before being doused in water. Assad\\'s authoritarian government previously denied accusations of torturing.\\n\\n## \\'Every minute it\\'s like you\\'re dying\\'\\n\\nDuring his detention in 2013, Abdullah describes how he would regularly hear the [screams of people being tortured. ](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c047579lzklo)\\n\\nHe recalls how diseases were rife and that about 20 people died while he was detained there.\\n\\n\"When I started to look around everywhere, there were people standing almost naked,\" he tells the BBC. \"They were full of blood, like they [have] been tortured.\\n\\n\"If you are not tortured yourself, every minute they will take someone to the investigation.\\n\\n\"They will get back to the room full of blood... every time you touch someone they will scream because you touched their wound.\"\\n\\nAfter 12 days, Abdullah was taken to be interrogated, where he says he was repeatedly beaten with a metal weapon and accused of transporting weapons.\\n\\nHe explains how he could not deny the accusations put forward to him as it would lead to prolonged punishment.\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nAbdullah said he would regularly hear people being tortured - later he would see them covered in blood with open wounds\\n\\n\"As long as you say, \\'I didn\\'t do it\\', they will keep torturing you and they will take you to another stage in torturing,\" he says.\\n\\n\"Every minute it\\'s like you\\'re dying.\"\\n\\nAbdullah says he told officers a false story to avoid further interrogation, and was \"lucky\" to be released from detention after a month. \\n\\nSeveral years later, he left Syria and was later granted scholarships in Geneva and the US. He is now settled in London with his wife.\\n\\nOnly now does Abdullah feel able to share the full horror of his experiences with his wife, as the risk and fear he faced is slowly disappearing.\\n\\n\"We finally finish[ed] with the regime, we can say, we are really free right now,\" he says.\\n\\n\"You can use our name. You can use our face. We can tell the full story.\"\\n\\nDouna, a human rights activist, sobbed as she heard her husband\\'s experiences for the first time.\\n\\n\"I was hearing him and I was crying. Every time I feel that this regime [has reached] the maximum of the horrors, of the horrible stories,\" she says.\\n\\n\"It surprises me that, no, this is not the maximum. There could be more.\"\\n\\nShe adds: \"We are privileged that we are able to tell our stories.

While I cannot access the full content due to technical limitations, the topic itself appears to be relatively lightweight travel content typical of lifestyle journalism. The bias rating of 45 reflects that while this is likely presented as a casual discussion piece, it may contain some leading language or predetermined stances on passenger behavior.
