I saw him weak. I saw him crying. I saw him saying: \\'This is where I was. I could be one of them. I could be one of them right now, or I could be dead\\'.\\n\\n\"I feel that when he saw this, he felt that this [was] closure,\" she adds. \"Now we want people to hear what Syrians went through.\"\\n\\nAbdullah, 36, was working in Damascus as a store keeper with the International Committee of the Red Cross in July 2013 when he and his colleagues were stopped at a checkpoint on the outskirts of the Syrian capital.\\n\\nHe says he participated in anti-regime protests in 2011 in the southern city of Deraa, where the uprising against Assad began, but soon distanced himself when rebels began to use violence and weapons in response to a brutal crackdown by the regime\\'s forces.\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nA cell in the basement of Al-Khatib \\n\\nAbdullah was singled out at the checkpoint and put on a green bus, handcuffed and blindfolded, and taken to a military area. He says he was then put in solitary confinement for three days and beaten.\\n\\n\"It was so dark for three days, I remember,\" he says. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t [hear] any sound. It was so dark. You hear nothing. You feel so lonely.\"\\n\\nAbdullah was then transported to Al-Khatib, a detention centre in Damascus, and taken to a cell with about 130 people.\\n\\nAl-Khatib was one of several detention facilities operated by Syrian intelligence services. \\n\\nAlmost 60,000 people were tortured and killed in the prisons run by the Assad regime during the civil war, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group.\\n\\nTwo years ago, a historic trial in Germany found [a Syrian colonel who worked in Al-Khatib guilty of crimes against humanity](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-59949924). Anwar Raslan, 58, was linked to the torture of over 4,000 people in the prison.\\n\\nIn court, witnesses described how detainees were [raped and hung from the ceiling](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56160486) for hours, as well as the use of electric shocks before being doused in water. Assad\\'s authoritarian government previously denied accusations of torturing.\\n\\n## \\'Every minute it\\'s like you\\'re dying\\'\\n\\nDuring his detention in 2013, Abdullah describes how he would regularly hear the [screams of people being tortured. ](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c047579lzklo)\\n\\nHe recalls how diseases were rife and that about 20 people died while he was detained there.\\n\\n\"When I started to look around everywhere, there were people standing almost naked,\" he tells the BBC. \"They were full of blood, like they [have] been tortured.\\n\\n\"If you are not tortured yourself, every minute they will take someone to the investigation.\\n\\n\"They will get back to the room full of blood... every time you touch someone they will scream because you touched their wound.\"\\n\\nAfter 12 days, Abdullah was taken to be interrogated, where he says he was repeatedly beaten with a metal weapon and accused of transporting weapons.\\n\\nHe explains how he could not deny the accusations put forward to him as it would lead to prolonged punishment.\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nAbdullah said he would regularly hear people being tortured - later he would see them covered in blood with open wounds\\n\\n\"As long as you say, \\'I didn\\'t do it\\', they will keep torturing you and they will take you to another stage in torturing,\" he says.\\n\\n\"Every minute it\\'s like you\\'re dying.\"\\n\\nAbdullah says he told officers a false story to avoid further interrogation, and was \"lucky\" to be released from detention after a month. \\n\\nSeveral years later, he left Syria and was later granted scholarships in Geneva and the US. He is now settled in London with his wife.\\n\\nOnly now does Abdullah feel able to share the full horror of his experiences with his wife, as the risk and fear he faced is slowly disappearing.\\n\\n\"We finally finish[ed] with the regime, we can say, we are really free right now,\" he says.\\n\\n\"You can use our name. You can use our face. We can tell the full story.\"\\n\\nDouna, a human rights activist, sobbed as she heard her husband\\'s experiences for the first time.\\n\\n\"I was hearing him and I was crying. Every time I feel that this regime [has reached] the maximum of the horrors, of the horrible stories,\" she says.\\n\\n\"It surprises me that, no, this is not the maximum. There could be more.\"\\n\\nShe adds: \"We are privileged that we are able to tell our stories.

Officials under investigation were disappeared into party compounds, hotels or other covert locations for months at a time, with no access to legal counsel or family visits. \\n\\nIn 2018, amid growing criticism over [widespread abuse, torture and forced confession](https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/06/asia/china-shuanggui-communist-party-torture/index.html), Xi scrapped the controversial practice known as “shuanggui,”or “double designation” –a nod to the party’s power to summon members for investigation at a designated time and place. \\n\\nBut the Chinese leader did not abolish secret detention, which had been a potent weapon in his war on corruption and dissent. Instead, it was codified by law, given a new name and placed under the purview of a powerful new state agency, the National Supervisory Commission (NSC). \\n\\nFounded in 2018 as part of the constitutional revision that cleared the way for Xi to rule for life, the new agency consolidated the government’s anti-graft forces and merged them with the CCDI. The two agencies work hand in glove and share the same offices, same personnel and even the same website – an arrangement that expands the remit of the party’s internal graft watchdog to the entire public sector. \\n\\nThe new liuzhi detention regime has kept many features of its predecessor, including the power to hold suspects incommunicado in custody and a lack of independent oversight. \\n\\nA criminal defense lawyer, who has represented Chinese officials in corruption cases, told CNN they had seen little improvement in the protection of detainees’ rights under liuzhi. \\n\\nAd Feedback\\n\\nThe lawyer, who requested anonymity due to fears of retribution from the government, said many of their clients had detailed abuse, threats and forced confessions while in liuzhi custody. \\n\\n“Most of them would succumb to the pressure and agony. Those who resisted until the end were a tiny minority,” the lawyer said. \\n\\nLiuzhi casts a much wider dragnet than shuanggui, targeting not only party members, but anyone who exercises “public power” – from officials and civil servants to managers of public schools, hospitals, sports organizations, cultural institutions and state-owned companies. It can also detain individuals deemed to be implicated in a graft case, such as businessmen suspected of paying bribes to an official under investigation. \\n\\nHigh-profile liuzhi detainees include [Bao Fan](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/tech/china-bao-fan-missing-mystery-bill-hnk-intl/index.html), a billionaire investment banker, and [Li Tie](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/13/china/china-soccer-star-coach-li-tie-prison-sentence-intl-hnk/index.html), a former English Premier League soccer star and coach of China’s national men’s team. (Li was sentenced to 20 years in prison for corruption this month.) At least 127 senior executives of publicly listed firms – many of them private businesses – have been taken into liuzhi custody, with three quarters of detentions taking place in the past two years alone, according to company announcements. \\n\\nthe expanded jurisdiction fills longstanding loopholes in the party’s anti-corruption fight and enables graft busters to go after everyday abuse of power endemic in the country’s behemoth public sector, from [bribes and kickbacks in hospitals](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/24/china/china-healthcare-corruption-crackdown-intl-hnk/index.html#:~:text=China's%20health%20care%20system%20has,distributed%20at%20in%2Dhouse%20pharmacies.) to misappropriation of school funds. \\n\\nCritics say it is another example of the party’s ever-tightening grip over the state and all aspects of society under Xi, China’s most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades. \\n\\nAd Feedback\\n\\nThe liuzhi detention center in Xianyang, Shaanxi province, where Chen Jianjun was held for six months, was built in 2018.\\n\\nGoogle Earth/CNN\\n\\nIn Golog prefecture, Qinghai province, the liuzhi detention center was built between 2019 and 2021 next to a county prison.\\n\\nMaxar Technologies/CNN\\n\\nBayannur, Inner Mongolia built its liuzhi detention center with a helipad in 2018 on the site of a special education school on the far outskirts of the city.

More detention centers have been built, and more funds have been allocated, in provinces and regions with a higher percentage of ethnic minorities. \\n\\nShizuishan, a city in the northwestern region of Ningxia – the official heartland of the Hui Muslim minority – was approved to build a 77,000 square feet liuzhi site with a budget of 20 million yuan ($2.8 million) in 2018, according to a . \\n\\nThe document provides a rare glimpse into what the interior looks like. All detention cells, interrogation rooms, and the infirmary must have fully padded walls, cabinets, tables, chairs and beds, with all edges rounded for safety. \\n\\nNo exposed electrical wiring or power sockets are allowed, and floors must be treated with anti-slip surfaces. All ceiling-mounted installations, including surveillance cameras, lights, fans and loudspeakers, must incorporate “anti-hanging designs.” In the bathrooms, washbasins and stainless-steel toilets must be fully padded too, while showerheads and surveillance cameras must be mounted on the ceiling, according to the notice. \\n\\nThese maximized safety features are designed to prevent detainees from taking their own lives – an issue that had long dogged shuanggui detentions. \\n\\nBut Shizuishan’s liuzhi center turned out to be too small for the influx of detainees. In June, the city published another notice seeking to expand the facility to address the problem of “insufficient facilities and equipment.” The project includes a new building for interrogation, a new staff canteen and reconfiguration of existing buildings to create more detention cells. \\n\\nThe party never published official figures on shuanggui detention, and the numbers on liuzhi are nearly as elusive. In 2023, the only year national data was available, were detained by the NSC and its local branches across the country _._\\n\\nProvincial data, although patchy, has pointed to a sharp increase in the number of detentions. In the northern region of Inner Mongolia, 17 times more people were placed under liuzhi custody in 2018 than those subject to shuanggui in 2017, according to . \\n\\nAuthorities appear to have laid down standard construction rules for liuzhi centers – including a national plan for building these facilities between 2023 and 2027 – which were cited repeatedly in government documents and tender notices viewed by CNN. \\n\\nDingxi, one of the poorest cities in the northwestern province of Gansu, said its 305-million-yuan ($42 million) detention center would be built following requirements specified by the CCDI and NSC to achieve the “standardized, law-based, and professional operations” of the liuzhi facility. \\n\\nThe massive complex, featuring 542 rooms, will include 32 detention cells, accommodation for investigators and guards to live on site, as well as other facilities to meet their daily needs, according to a 2024 budget document of the city’s anti-graft agency. \\n\\n##  Life under liuzhi \\n\\nChinese officials and state media have hailed the transition from shuanggui to liuzhi as a crucial step toward what they describe as “the rule of law in anti-corruption work.” \\n\\nThe shuanggui system had long been criticized for using threats, intense pressure or to secure confessions. A 2016 by Human Rights Watch documented 11 deaths in shuanggui custody from 2010 to 2015, and numerous instances of abuse and torture. \\n\\nUnlike shuanggui, which had no legal basis, liuzhi is inscribed in the national supervision law – introduced in 2018 to regulate the NSC. \\n\\nThe law bans investigators from collecting evidence through illegal means such as threats and deception; it prohibits insulting, scolding, beating, abusing and any form of corporal punishment of those under investigation. The law also requires interrogations to be recorded on video. \\n\\nSketches drawn by Chen Jianjun describing his experience in Xianyang Supervisory Commission detention center for six months in 2022.\\n\\nObtained by CNN\\n\\nBut legal experts say the legislation only wraps around a detention regime that operates outside the judicial system, lacks external oversight and remains inherently prone to abuse. \\n\\n“In the past, it was extra-legal. Now, some critics call it ‘legally illegal,’” said a Chinese legal scholar who has studied the NSC. They spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fears of government retribution. \\n\\nChina’s opaque court system, which answers to the Communist Party, already boasts a conviction rate above 99%. \\n\\nBut unlike criminal arrests, liuzhi takes place outsidethe judicial process and does not allow access to legal representation, raising concerns for potential abuse of power, said a second Chinese scholar who also requested anonymity. \\n\\nIn September, Zhou Tianyong, a top economist and former professor at the elite Central Party School, where the Communist Party trains its senior officials, warned that local authorities had been using corruption probes to extort money from private entrepreneurs to fill their strained coffers. \\n\\nIn a viral that was later censored, Zhou called for an end to the practice by local anti-graft agencies of detaining businessmen on suspected or trumped-up bribery charges and forcing them to pay for their release. “If (this trend) spreads, it will undoubtedly lead to another disaster for the national economy,” Zhou wrote. \\n\\nIn recent years, allegations of abuse and forced confessions have emerged in multiple liuzhi cases publicized online. \\n\\nAmong them is Chen Jianjun, an architect-turned-local official who claimed he was deceived and forced into making false confessions of bribe-taking while detained under liuzhi in 2022 in the northwestern city of Xianyang. \\n\\nDuring his six months of detention, the 57-year-old was watched by rotating pairs of guards around the clock and forced to sit upright for 18 hours a day without moving or speaking, with any slightest bending of his back immediately met with reprimands from the guards, according to a written account of his experience posted on social platform WeChat. \\n\\nTwo people familiar with the case confirmed to CNN that the account was written by Chen and published by his daughter, Chen Lu. The post also includes photos of three sketches drawn by Chen Jianjun on toilet paper, describing his life under liuzhi. \\n\\nChen was only allowed to sleep for less than six hours a day under bright lights that were never switched off; in bed, he must lie on his back and keep his hands above the blanket in sight of the guards, he wrote. \\n\\n“The prolonged torment left me physically and mentally exhausted, with blurred consciousness, a mental breakdown, chaotic thoughts and hallucinations,” Chen wrote, adding that by the time he emerged from liuzhi, he had lost 15 kilograms. \\n\\nChen’s daughter did not respond to CNN’s requests for interview. His lawyer declined to comment. \\n\\nIn 2023, Chen was sentenced to six years in prison for accepting bribes of 2.5 million yuan ($340,000). He appealed and is waiting for a ruling, , a business magazine known for its investigative reporting. \\n\\nCNN has reached out to the Xianyang government and the Xianyang municipal supervisory commission for comment. \\n\\nThe Chinese lawyer who represented officials in court after they were released from liuzhi custody said it was common for detainees to be forced to sit in one position for up to 18 hours a day. \\n\\n“They had to sit continuously without moving, causing severe pressure ulcers on their buttocks. Some medicine would be applied, but they were made to continue sitting, leading to further deterioration. It was extremely torturous,” they said. \\n\\nSome clients were also given very little food until they confessed, causing malnutrition and a host of other health problems, the lawyer said. “Many people eventually developed auditory hallucinations and felt like they were losing their minds,” they said. \\n\\nAccording to the lawyer, another tactic commonly used by investigators was to detain an official and their spouse simultaneously, even if the spouse did not hold public office. \\n\\nIt’s a two-pronged approach: investigators can try to gather clues about the official’s alleged transgression from the spouse; while the spouse can be held hostage to pressure the official to confess, the lawyer explained. \\n\\nIn some cases, investigators had also threatened to detain officials’ children for interrogation, the lawyer added. \\n\\nA draft amendment to the national supervision law, which is under review by China’s top legislature, appears to nod to concerns of potential abuse. It added a clause that requires investigators to carry out investigations in a “lawful, civilized and standardized manner.” \\n\\nBut the draft proposal has ignored calls to allow access to legal counsel during liuzhi detention. Instead, it has suggested extending the maximum detention period from six months to eight months, if the suspect is likely to be sentenced to a prison term of 10 years or longer; the entire liuzhi period can be reset and restarted if new offenses are discovered, meaning a maximum of 16 months of custody, according to the proposal. \\n\\nThe draft amendment has sparked heated debate and criticism from Chinese lawyers and legal scholars, who say the powers granted to investigators during liuzhi have far outweighed the protection of detainees’ rights. \\n\\n“Prolonged detention and interrogation present an extreme test that surpasses the physical and mental limits of the detainee,” Dacheng, a Beijing-based law firm, said in an on its social media account. \\n\\n“Under such extreme conditions, where both the body and the mind are pushed to their limits, it becomes increasingly difficult to tell whether the detainee is giving an ‘honest confession’ based on facts or opting for ‘full cooperation’ by compromising the truth under unbearable pressure.” \\n\\nHow CNN reported this story:CNN obtained tender notices containing the keyword “liuzhi” published online between 2017 and November 30, 2024. These were manually reviewed and classified as new detention center construction projects, expansions and transformations of existing detention facilities, and other projects.CNN identified more than 200 projects involving construction or expansion of liuzhi facilities, and compiled corresponding land area, building area, budget, bidding document dates, and construction periods for each project where data was available. CNN cross-checked these projects with government procurement notices provided by ChinaFile, an online magazine published by the nonprofit Asia Society.CNN used China’s 2020 census data to determine each province’s total population and ethnic minority population, as well as the national data. We categorized provinces where the proportion of ethnic minority population was higher than the national average as “provinces and regions with a higher percentage of ethnic minorities.” \\n\\nReporting: Yong Xiong and CNN staffGraphics: Soph Warnes, Lou Robinson and Rosa de AcostaIllustration and animations: Duncan Senkumba \\n\"},\n",

Few of the Windsor clan would have anticipated the challenges they’d have to face in the infancy of [King Charles III](https://www.cnn.com/2013/06/27/world/europe/prince-charles-fast-facts/index.html)’s reign. \\n\\nIt was perhaps best summed up by his heir apparent, Prince William, who candidly categorized 2024 as “brutal” and probably “the hardest year in my life.” \\n\\nFor Russell Myers, the royal editor of Britain’s The Mirror newspaper, the past 12 months have been astonishing. “It’s been a simply unprecedented time for both the individuals who have had separate health ailments, but also, in a wider sense, (a) really testing time for other members of the family.” \\n\\nAd Feedback\\n\\nAd Feedback\\n\\n“Certainly, for the King and Princess of Wales to be in hospital at the same time was incredibly rare, but then to be diagnosed with cancer within days of each other was simply extraordinary,” he told CNN. \\n\\nMyers recalled the hurricane of unfounded, and at times ludicrous, [conspiracy theories that swirled ](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/22/uk/kate-hysteria-royal-newsletter-032224-intl-scli-gbr-cmd/index.html)around Catherine earlier this year. “In all my years in the job, I’ve never known a period of hysteria like it and a lot of people forgot that at the center was a young mother who had undergone a serious operation and needed time to recover,” he continued. \\n\\nThe King and his daughter-in-law’s diagnoses stunned royal-watchers, but their disclosures also heralded a change in the royal modus operandi. \\n\\nPeople watch a broadcast in a London pub following the announcement by the Princess of Wales that she is undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer.\\n\\nAaron Chown/Press Association/AP\\n\\n“We saw a real openness with the royal family that we haven’t seen quite so much of before,” said Lizzie Robinson, a royal journalist for Britain’s ITV News, recalling the Princess of Wales’ video messages and the monarch’s disclosure that he had initially gone to hospital for a corrective procedure for an enlarged prostate. \\n\\n“He wanted to help raise awareness and was keen to encourage other men who might be experiencing symptoms to get checked. After he made his announcement, there was a significant rise in the searches on the NHS website,” Robinson added. “I think that showed the royal family were maybe taking a more modern approach in the way they deal with some things.” \\n\\nAmid the health issues, Prince William also took a step back from his royal duties to support his family, leaving the 1,000-year-old institution without three of its most senior members. \\n\\n“Camilla really[ kept that royal show](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/18/uk/charles-kate-health-royals-newsletter-intl/index.html) on the road for quite a few months,” Robinson said, before adding that she was, of course, supported by other Windsors, including Princess Anne and the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. \\n\\nMyers points out that Queen Camilla “wouldn’t have expected to be front and center of the institution at large.” \\n\\nHe added: “Camilla’s transition over the last couple of decades has been extraordinary because at one point in the not too distant history she was public enemy number one. There were questions over whether she would be accepted by the British public and beyond and now she is this pillar of the institution.” \\n\\nQueen Camilla at an event in Buckingham Palace on February 22.\\n\\nAaron Chown/WPA Pool/Getty Images\\n\\nWilliam[ returned to public engagements](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/18/uk/prince-william-return-public-duties-intl-scli/index.html) in April and has since deftly juggled his work and personal life. As he picked up extra childcare duties behind the scenes while Kate continued to recuperate, he also twice stepped up to represent the King at state events in France. The pressure on the heir would have been considerable, both personally and professionally. \\n\\nWhen he stood[ shoulder to shoulder with heads of state](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/06/europe/prince-william-king-charles-d-day-anniversary-intl/index.html) at the D-Day commemorations in June and again at the reopening of[ Notre Dame](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/07/style/france-notre-dame-reopens-intl-cmd/index.html) cathedral in December, we got a glimpse of how the monarchy may feel when he eventually takes the crown. He would have been aware of the optics of those moments and considered how he wanted to play them. \\n\\nAhead of William’s Notre Dame appearance, a royal source pointed to the “evolution of the Prince of Wales as a global statesman” in the past two years and how this was a further example of him “stepping up onto the world stage to represent the United Kingdom.” \\n\\nAny heir to a throne must always have their destiny in the back of their minds. But with his father’s reduced travel schedule, William has been getting some practice sooner than he might have imagined. \\n\\nWhen they met in Paris, US President-elect Donald Trump said William was “doing a fantastic job,” illustrating the soft power the British royal family still wields. \\n\\nPrince William joins world leaders at the international commemorative ceremony at Omaha Beach marking the 80th anniversary of the World War II \"D-Day\" Allied landings in Normandy, northwestern France, on June 6.\\n\\nLudovic Marin/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nChallenges for the Windsors weren’t confined to Britain. Across the Atlantic, Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex[ embarked on several trips](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/africa/prince-harry-meghan-nigerian-visit-intl-scli/index.html) abroad to Nigeria, Canada and[ Colombia](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/uk/harry-meghan-royal-family-colombia-intl/index.html) to promote their charity work, and projects such as Invictus and online child safety. While they weren’t official visits on behalf of the UK government, there was an air of traditional royal tour about them, complete with stately welcomes and meetings with high-profile figures. \\n\\nThe visits illustrated how the couple can operate outside the royal infrastructure and promote their causes and initiatives, while simultaneously demonstrating that they can still draw crowds. \\n\\nThe Sussexes have also continued to push forward with their business endeavors. In March, Meghan returned to Instagram after a six-year hiatus to tease a new lifestyle venture,[ “American Riviera Orchard.”](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/american-riviera-orchard-first-product-scli-intl/index.html) She then sent out what appeared to be a sample of what was to come – jars of strawberry jam – to friends and influencers, but movement on the project at least in public has stalled in the months since. \\n\\nTheir latest Netflix offering, which gave viewers an inside look at the world of professional polo, received mixed reviews when it was released in December. Meanwhile, Netflix’s mid-year data dump of streaming figures for the second half of 2023 revealed that their “Heart of Invictus” series, which premiered on the platform last August, racked up just 300,000 views, according to \\n\\nThe Sussexes’ stateside projects may appear to have stumbled but one PR expert said you shouldn’t count them out. Peter Mancusi, a crisis management expert and associate professor of journalism at Northeastern University, told CNN the couple wanted to reclaim their own narrative when they relocated to the US and the public was sympathetic to that. \\n\\nPrince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, greets an artist, next to his wife Meghan during a visit to the National Centre for the Arts in Bogota, Colombia on August 15, 2024\\n\\nRaul Arboleda/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\n“The next phase was starting all these businesses and things,” he explained. “Sympathy can turn to skepticism very quickly and people can think that you’re doing a little too much to cash in on these family problems.” \\n\\nThe picture of the couple right now is pretty blurry, he said. “I think their challenge is to make it more clear to people what they stand for, what their identity is, and what they’re trying to build going forward.” CNN reached out to the Sussexes about their plans for the year ahead but had not heard back before publication. \\n\\n[ King Charles III recorded his Christmas message at the Fitzrovia Chapel in central London on December 11.

That is, until a High Court hearing revealed his close relationship [with an alleged Chinese spy.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/16/uk/yang-tengbo-uk-china-alleged-spy-court-gbr-intl/index.html) Yang Tengbo was the co-founder of Pitch@Palace China, an initiative for entrepreneurs Andrew set up a decade ago. \\n\\nThe hearing upheld an earlier decision to bar Yang from the UK, but disclosed that he had been authorized to act on the duke’s behalf during business meetings with potential Chinese investors in the UK, and had been invited to Andrew’s 60th birthday party in 2020. The duke’s office subsequently told British media that the royal had “ceased all contact” when concerns had been raised about Yang. But the developments once again called into question his judgement and the company he has chosen to keep. \\n\\n“When it comes to the Duke of York, you have to expect the unexpected,” Myers told CNN. “Andrew is simply a problem that will never go away.” \\n\\nHe said it was too early to understand the scandal’s effect on the monarchy but suggested it could be a wake-up call for the duke “that he would be much better completely withdrawing from public life, and any sense that he may have had that there was a route back for him is completely extinguished now.” \\n\\nKing Charles III and Queen Camilla view a sheep dog demonstration as they attend a community BBQ on October 22 in Sydney.\\n\\nBrook Mitchell/Getty Images\\n\\nBy year’s end, King Charles and Queen Camilla had resumed overseas visits, carrying out a 10-day trip to Australia and Samoa. Robinson, who was one of the many royal reporters on the tour, described a “real warmth and appreciation” that they’d made the long-haul journey while Charles was still undergoing cancer treatment. \\n\\n“Going into 2025 we already know that the King is working on a full overseas tour program as long as there’s doctors’ approval, that Prince William has spoken about how hopefully he and Catherine will have some more trips lined up,” she said. “They will be hoping that things can return to some sort of normal again.” \\n\\nA palace source told CNN that Charles’ “treatment has been moving in a positive direction” and “will continue into next year.” The source added that this doesn’t reflect any change, development or significant update on details that have already been released. \\n\\nCNN’s Billy Stockwell contributed to this story. \\n\\nAd Feedback\\n\\nAd Feedback\\n\\nAd Feedback\\n'},\n",

Not just for myself but holding everyone together. … And I am okay with anyone criticizing me. Because again, I get paid to handle that.” \\n\\nThe Kings are currently in 12th place in the Western Conference. \\n\\nBrown had a 107-88 record in regular season play in two-plus years in the capital city of California. \\n\\nMany coaches around the league showed their support for Brown including Brooklyn Nets coach Jordi Fernandez, who coached under Brown in Sacramento the last few seasons. \\n\\n“He’s very good at what he does. In my opinion, he’s one of the best,” Fernandez told reporters ahead of the Nets’ game against the San Antonio Spurs on Friday. “I wouldn’t be here without him. Obviously, to me, it’s really sad news, and I don’t like it. But it’s part of the business.” \\n\\nThe firing also drew the ire of Denver Nuggets head coach Mike Malone. Malone was fired by the Kings during the 2014-2015 season. \\n\\n“l’m not surprised that Mike Brown got fired, because I got fired by the same person,” Malone said. “… No class, no balls. That’s what I’ll say about that.” \\n\\nPreviously, Brown coached the Cleveland Cavaliers twice and the Los Angeles Lakers. He has a 455-304 career record and has made the playoffs in seven of his nine seasons as a head coach. He has also won four NBA championships including three while as an assistant coach with the Golden State Warriors. \\n\\nThe Kings are next scheduled to play Saturday in Los Angeles against LeBron James and the Lakers. \\n\\nAd Feedback\\n\\nAd Feedback\\n\\nAd Feedback\\n'},\n",

Prior to this they were believed to be extinct - neither species had been spotted for a century.\\n\\nWhen a team of conservationists found a small population surviving on the rocky cliffs of Deserta Grande island, close to Madeira, they mounted a rescue effort. \\n\\nThe snails were brought to zoos in the UK and France, including Chester Zoo, where a home was created for them in a converted shipping container. \\n\\nChester Zoo\\n\\nA newly hatched snail at Chester Zoo sits on a five pence coin\\n\\nThe tiny molluscs are native to the windswept, mountainous island of Deserta Grande, just south-east of Madeira. Habitat there has been destroyed by rats, mice and goats that were brought to the island by humans. \\n\\nIt was thought that all these invasive predators had eaten the tiny snails to extinction. Then a series of conservation expeditions - between 2012 and 2017 - proved otherwise. \\n\\nConservationists discovered just 200 surviving individuals on the island.\\n\\nGerardo Garcia/Chester Zoo\\n\\nThe snails are native to the Desertas Islands\\n\\nThose snails were believed to be the last of their kind, so they were collected and brought into captivity. \\n\\nAt Chester Zoo, the conservation science team made a new home for 60 of the precious snails. The right food, vegetation and conditions were recreated in miniature habitat tanks. \\n\\n1,329 snail offspring, bred at the zoo, have now been marked with identification dots - using non-toxic pens and nail varnish - and transported back to the wild for release.\\n\\n\"[It\\'s a] colour code,\" said Dinarte Teixeira, a conservation biologist at Madeira\\'s Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests. \"This will allow us to spot them and track where they disperse to, how much they grow, how many survive and how well they adapt to their new environment.\"\\n\\nChester Zoo\\n\\nThe zoo-bred snails, carefully packed into their travel containers for their journey to Bugio Island \\n\\nChester Zoo\\n\\nThe dots are visible under ultraviolet light, which will allow the conservationists to find and monitor the snails \\n\\nA wild refuge has been restored for the snails on Bugio, a smaller neighbouring island in the Ilhas Desertas (Desert Islands) archipelago.\\n\\nBugio is a nature reserve and invasive species have been eradicated there. \\n\\nGerardo Garcia from Chester Zoo said that the reintroduction was \"a major step in a species recovery plan\".\\n\\n\"If it goes as well as we hope, more snails will follow them next spring. It\\'s a huge team effort which shows that it is possible to turn things around for highly threatened species.\"\\n\\nGerardo Garcia/Chester Zoo\\n\\nMembers of the conservation team on Bugio Island ahead of the release of the snails \\n\\n\"These snails are such an important part of the natural habitat [on the islands they come from],\" explained Heather Prince from Chester Zoo. As well as being food for other native species, she explained, snails break down organic matter and bring nutrients to the soil. \\n\\n\"They help plants grow. All of that is dependent on the little guys - the insects and the snails that so often get overlooked.\"\\n\\nMore on this topic\\n\\n## [Trouble in Arctic town as polar bears and people face warming world](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yg344zz1ro)\\n\\n## [Crossbows and eerie silences – following Antarctic whales for climate change clues](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj770nrx0x9o)\\n\\n## [X-rays reveal tiny half-billion-year-old creature](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgxqdygpn09o)\\n\\n[Invasive species](/news/topics/c0x61qevvrxt)\\n\\n[Chester Zoo](/news/topics/c1nqnqr6e1yt)\\n\\n[Endangered species](/news/topics/c1xp19dn8ret)\\n\\n[Conservation](/news/topics/c207p54mdd3t)\\n\\n[Science & Environment](/news/science_and_environment)\\n\\n[Wildlife](/news/topics/ce2gz91g2jmt)\\n\\n[Nature](/news/topics/ckd09zdlvk2t)\\n\\n[Insects](/news/topics/cnegp3zl2pyt)\\n\\n[Environment](/news/topics/cnx753jenyjt)\\n\\nRelated\\n\\n## [\\'Murder hornets\\' eradicated in the US, officials say18 Dec 2024](/news/articles/c77jdjm02mvo)\\n\\n## [Volunteers find 24 Asian hornet nests in one week28 Oct 2024Jersey](/news/articles/cq6l2llmq9do)\\n\\n## [Woody the dog switches detection skills to save puffins21 Oct 2024Northern Ireland](/news/articles/c4g019y97ygo)\\n\\nMore\\n\\n[7 mins agoWhat does it take to clear an Asian hornets\\' nest?Experts say the battle to remove the invasive species is only going to grow.7 mins agoGuernsey](/news/articles/c74x82lvgrvo)\\n\\n[1 hr agoPlight of loughs and rivers dominates environment newsFrom Lough Neagh to Belfast Lough, concerns about the health of our waterways hit the headlines.](/news/articles/c8ew6r5gld9o)\\n\\n[6 hrs agoLost city found by accident and rhino IVF breakthrough: 2024\\'s scientific winsMoments to celebrate included a solar eclipse seen by millions and a lost city discovered by accident.](/news/articles/cm2v1rl32j8o)\\n\\n[14 hrs agoInquiry over pollution incident in River WyeWelsh Water confirms a form of oil has got into the river, adding it was investigating the source.](/news/articles/c4gp4yel8kko)\\n\\n[24 hrs agoThe puppies trained to save wildlife in AfricaThe team has trained and deployed 15 dogs to work in five sub-Saharan African countries.](/news/videos/cgrw4yrwe0do)\\n'},\n",

The beating was described in a deposition by an investigator for the New York Department of Corrections Office of Special Investigations.\\n\\nBrooks had been transferred to Marcy Correctional Facility on the day of the attack from nearby Mohawk Correctional Facility.\\n\\nHe was pronounced dead at a local hospital the following day, according to New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office is investigating the incident.\\n\\n\"As attorney general, you have my word that we will use every possible tool to investigate this death thoroughly and swiftly,\" James said in a press conference Friday.\\n\\nBody-worn camera footage from correctional officers at the Marcy Correctional Facility released by the New York Attorney General\\'s Office\\n\\nNew York Attorney General\\'s Office\\n\\nElizabeth Mazur, an attorney for the Brooks family, told ABC News, \"Members of the public can now view for themselves the horrific and extreme nature of the deadly attack on Robert L. Brooks. As viewers can see, Mr. Brooks was fatally, violently beaten by a group of officers whose job was to keep him safe. He deserved to live, and everyone else living in Marcy Correctional Facility deserves to know they do not have to live in fear of violence at the hands of prison staff.\"\\n\\nDetails of Brooks\\' death were outlined in the state investigator\\'s deposition filed Tuesday by New York State Police.\\n\\nThe deposition was filed by Ryan Paparella, an investigator for the Department of Corrections and Community Services and was brought in to review this incident. In the deposition, Paparella , details his assessment of the body camera footage showing Brooks\\' attack.\\n\\nPaparella did not mention any apparent provocation or motive in his deposition and noted Brooks had his arms and legs restrained throughout the 15-minute assault. Paparella is a former corrections officer at the same prison where the incident took place.\\n\\nPaparella\\'s deposition stated: \"The male was on the ground [outside near a fence]... I observed correction officers pick up the male off the ground who was handcuffed with his hands behind his back. The hands of the black male were extended directly above his head as his upper torso was parallel with the ground. They continued to walk the male down the sidewalk and towards an open door of the infirmary.\"\\n\\nBody-worn camera footage from correctional officers at the Marcy Correctional Facility released by the New York Attorney General\\'s Office\\n\\nNew York Attorney General\\'s Office\\n\\nPaparella reported a corrections officer delivered a \"closed fist strike to the chest\" while Brooks was handcuffed, and detailed officers pushing Brooks\\' body up against an interior window.\\n\\nPreliminary findings of Brooks\\' autopsy by the Onondaga County Medical Examiner\\'s Office, \"show concern for asphyxia due to compression of the neck as the cause of death, as well as the death being due to actions of another,\" New York State Police wrote in a court filing.\\n\\nPaparella detailed that two sergeants and a nurse watched the attack and neglected to intervene. They are among the 14 prison staffers whom New York Gov. Kathy Hochul ordered to be terminated by the state.\\n\\n\"Like all New Yorkers, I was outraged and horrified after seeing footage of the senseless killing of Robert Brooks. I have been clear that it is the responsibility of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision to provide appropriate care and protection for those in its custody, and I will not tolerate anyone who violates that responsibility,\" Hochul said in a statement Friday. \"The State of New York has zero tolerance for individuals who break the law, and I am committed to holding everyone involved fully accountable.\"\\n\\nOne of the officers who Paparella reported participated in the incident is currently facing civil litigation for his alleged involvement in the 2020 beating of another inmate at Marcy Correctional, according to court records.\\n\\nThe New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association issued a statement reading, \"What we witnessed is incomprehensible to say the least and is certainly not reflective of the great work that the vast majority of our membership conducts every day... This incident has the potential to make our correctional facilities even more violent, hostile, and unpredictable than ever before.\"\\n\\nThe Correctional Association of New York (CANY), a state oversight group, said in a statement that terminating staff involved in the incident \"is a good start, but Governor Kathy Hochul and the legislature must go much further.\"\\n\\n\"They need to take bold and courageous actions to fulfill past commitments and bring about a new era of transparency and accountability in state government,\" the reads.\\n\\nA 2023 CANY on Marcy Correctional Facility found that four out of five prisoners reported witnessing or experiencing abuse and seven out of 10 prisoners reported racial discrimination from guards.\\n\\nOne person interviewed at Marcy correctional facility told CANY: \"Physical abuse is rampant; the [correction officer] told me when I got here: \\'This is a hands-on facility, we\\'re going to put hands on you if we don\\'t like what you\\'re doing.\\'\"\\n\\nThe New York Civil Liberties Union stated Brooks\\' death \"highlights a culture of violence and a lack of accountability for wrongdoing by corrections officers that puts the lives of incarcerated New Yorkers at risk.\"\\n\\nA 2024 review by the Department of Justice found that at least 28 incarcerated people were murdered while in custody during 2022, with 50 deaths classified as \"accidental,\" a term that is not defined in the report.\\n\\nJames, the attorney general, announced Friday that four involved officers did not turn their body-worn cameras on, which violates state policy, however, the cameras recorded in standby mode with no audio.\\n\\nDepartment of Corrections Commissioner Daniel F. Martuscello III issued a memo this month, stating corrections officers\\' must have their body cameras actively recording during any interaction with inmates. Martuscello wrote that employees must \"immediately report any individual who intentionally or unintentionally circumvents the [body-worn camera] policy.\"\\n\\n“This was a killing, and people will be held accountable,\" according to a statement issued by Martuscello following Brooks\\' death. “No one is above the law and everyone who works here is held to the highest ethical standards. These individuals are not representative of the culture of DOCCS nor anything that DOCCS stands for. I am committed to vigorously pursuing justice for the Brooks family and ensuring that our agency takes the necessary steps to heal the community.”\\n\\nBrooks was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2017 for stabbing his girlfriend in Monroe County.\\n\\nThirteen of the staffers have been suspended without pay and one resigned the day after the incident.\\n\\nThe investigation is still ongoing with the New York AG\\'s Office and the NY Dept of Corrections Office of Special Investigations.\\n\\n## [California man fatally shot by his parole officer, authorities say\\n\\n  * Dec 27, 5:54 PM\\n\\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/california-man-fatally-shot-parole-officer-authorities-117158104)\\n\\n## [\\'Deeply concerned\\': Reagan FBI director urges caution against Trump appointees\\n\\n  * Dec 28, 10:30 AM\\n\\n](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/reagan-fbi-director-urges-caution-gabbard-patel/story?id=117166000)\\n\\n## [Churches close their doors as fewer Americans attend\\n\\n  * Dec 28, 9:18 AM\\n\\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/churches-fight-stay-open-attendance-dwindles/story?id=116905100)\\n\\n## [Woman sleeping in truck killed in explosion at Tyson Foods plant\\n\\n  * Dec 27, 1:13 PM\\n\\n](https://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-sleeping-truck-killed-explosion-tyson-foods-plant/story?id=117153151)\\n\\n## [Azerbaijan Airlines crew member who survived plane crash speaks out from hospital\\n\\n  * Dec 28, 6:26 AM\\n\\n](https://abcnews.go.com/International/survivors-azerbaijan-airlines-plane-crash-report-hearing-bangs/story?id=117150667)\\n\\n### ABC News Live\\n\\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\\n\\nBack Button\\n\\n### Performance Cookies\\n\\nFilter Icon\\n\\nClear\\n\\ncheckbox label label\\n\\nApply Cancel\\n'},\n",

The reporting is primarily fact-based, supported by official documentation, video evidence, and multiple perspectives from relevant parties. While the headline uses emotionally charged language (\"shocking\"), the body of the article maintains professional distance in its reporting. The bias score of 25 reflects the generally objective approach, with slight emotional elements mainly in quoted material and the headline. The negative sentiment classification stems from the nature of the story itself - describing a death in custody and alleged abuse - rather than from editorial slant.

The bill gives wide latitude to the president to delay its enforcement if there’s progress being made towards a deal that ensures TikTok isn’t fully controlled by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. \\n\\nBut the deadline for that determination is January 19th, which is one day before Trump is set to be sworn in.\\n\\nIn his Supreme Court filing, Trump asks for the bill’s January 19th deadline to be stayed, arguing that the deal he’d negotiate “would obviate the need for this Court to decide the historically challenging First Amendment question presented here on the current, highly expedited basis.” \\n\\nHe offers no details on what said deal would look like, though it would likely have to involve ByteDance selling a signification portion of its ownership in TikTok to an American company.\\n\\n### Related\\n\\n  * [The long-shot plan to save TikTok from a US ban](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320722/frank-mccourt-project-liberty-tiktok-us-ban-bytedance)\\n  * [TikTok failed to save itself with the First Amendment](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316941/tiktok-divest-ban-court-ruling-breakdown-first-amendment)\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump argues that having over 14 million followers on TikTok, along with his ownership of Truth Social, gives him unique ability to “evaluate TikTok’s importance as a unique medium for freedom of expression, including core political speech.” He also cites [Brazil’s temporary ban of Elon Musk’s X](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24232573/brazil-x-twitter-ban-elon-musk) as an example of “the historic dangers presented” by a government banning a social media platform.\\n\\nWhile Trump [pushed aggressively for a TikTok ban](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445060/trump-tiktok-wechat-ban-us-apple-app-store-google-play-commerce-department) during his first term, he changed his tune after his campaign successfully used the video app during the 2024 election. He recently [met with TikTok CEO Shou Chew](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/16/24322852/tiktok-ceo-trump-meeting-ban) at Mar-a-Lago and that “maybe we gotta keep this sucker around for a little while.”\\n\\nThere’s still plenty of political pressure to enforce a TikTok ban, however. A group of senators and congressmen, including Mitch McConnell and Ro Khanna, , joined by 22 U.S. states and former FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, urging the Supreme Court to reject TikTok’s appeal.\\n\\nComments69 Comments / 69 New\\n\\n## More from this stream [TikTok ban: all the news on attempts to ban the video platform](/23651507/tiktok-ban-us-news)\\n\\n  * ### [Just thinking about TikTok.](/2024/12/23/24328428/just-thinking-about-tiktok)\\n\\nDec 23, 2024, 2:36 PM PST\\n\\n  * ### [TikTok finally scores a win: the Supreme Court will hear its case](/2024/12/18/24324293/supreme-court-tiktok-ban-case-granted-oral-arguments)\\n\\nDec 18, 2024, 8:27 AM PST\\n\\n  * ### [Civil society groups to SCOTUS: stop the TikTok ban to preserve free speech.](/2024/12/17/24323683/civil-society-groups-to-scotus-stop-the-tiktok-ban-to-preserve-free-speech)\\n\\nDec 17, 2024, 12:29 PM PST\\n\\n  * ### [TikTok CEO meets with Trump as the platform tries to avoid a ban](/2024/12/16/24322852/tiktok-ceo-trump-meeting-ban)\\n\\nDec 16, 2024, 2:48 PM PST\\n\\n\\n[See all 145 stories](/23651507/tiktok-ban-us-news)\\n\\nSPONSORED CONTENT\\n\\nSubscribe and get a limited edition magazine shipped to your door.
